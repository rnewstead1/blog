The system consists of a Java backend with a Cassandra database and a front end React service. I was also personally resonsible for the deployment pipeline of the application to Google Cloud using Kubernetes and Docker.</p></li><li><h4>GOV UK Verify, Government Digital Service</h4><p>I worked on the GOV UK Verify project which provides a single, secure way for individuals to access government services online. The system consists of numerous microservices written in Java using the Dropwizard framework. To ensure security, messages between these microservices and external systems use SAML.</p><p>This involves working in a support role for one week every month. This includes speaking with different third parties, releasing to test and production environments daily, and solving problems that arise in production.</p></li><li><h4>Identity Assurance for Organisations and Agents Alpha, Government Digital Service</h4><p>I worked on a small team at the Government Digital Service to build a prototype in Clojure to investigate a single sign-in service for the government for businesses.

Development was mainly in Java writing to an Oracle database and communicating using XML via an ActiveMQ message broker. I worked on a mixture of legacy systems using Spring and Hibernate, and newer, more lightweight systems designed around business events. I enjoyed using functional libraries such as Guava and Totally Lazy to make transforming collections simple and elegant. I also developed a small Scala application, and found Scala’s support for overloading operators to be perfect for creating a simple DSL to route messages.</p><p>This was an Agile environment: pair programming was standard, using a test driven development approach and starting from an acceptance test to define the business requirement. I led numerous retrospectives for other teams and believe that effective communication is key to making a team work well.</p></li><li><h3>Technology Graduate, BSkyB</h3><p><i>July 2009 - July 2011</i></p><p>Two year graduate scheme consisting of a six week intensive training course on all areas of the software lifecycle and four six month placements in various technology departments.
