I recently ran a personal values workshop for some teammates which was a fun and valuable exercise.
There are lots of suggestions on how to run a workshop like this on the internet, and after some research, this is what we did.

TODO: Start with an introduction to values. What are they, and why are they important?

Everyone created their own miro board from a template (link). You don't need a template or miro - you just need 10 post-it notes.

1. Start by writing down 10 values that are important to you, one on each post-it note.
We used this list for ideas, but you can pick values that are not on there too - as long as they're important to you.
There is no right or wrong answer. It's ok for this first part to take a while - we took 5 minutes and that felt a little rushed.
By the end of the time you should feel comfortable that once you have 10 values in your list, they are all important to you.

2. Next, we refine the values. 10 is a lot. You have 30 seconds. Discard the 3 _least_ important to you from the values you wrote down.

3. Now you have 20 seconds to discard 2 more.

4. For the last time - 20 seconds, discard 2 more. This is meant to be hard!

5. You now have your 3 core values. You might want to reword them or better define what they mean to you, add notes about why you chose them. Maybe you discarded something because you decided it was encompassed by one of your remaining values - add that note.
Maybe you feel super uncomfortable about one of your last discards and want to bring that back in - that's ok. Having 3 - 5 core values is best.

Ask the following questions:

- What do I feel about the values I ended up with?
- Were they as expected or did they surprise me?
- How do these values show themselves in my everyday life?
- What actions do I already take to live by them?
- What actions would I like to take to live by them?

Here's what I came up with:
- Honesty
- Freedom
- Empathy

For me personally doing this exercise was powerful as it made me realise that there were some things going on in my life that directly conflicted with my personal values.
When I realised this it intuitively made sense - I'd been feeeling a deep sense of discomfort and couldn't put my finger on why.
Having a clear set of values helped me better articulate what I was feeling, and then change the situation.
Since doing this exercise I've left a job that had become bad for me.
I've started somewhere new where I feel aligned with the values of my team and company.

Finally, your values are not static and are likely to change over time. They should be memorable and things that you feel strongly about at your core.
