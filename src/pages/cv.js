                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I've been a software engineer for nine years, working across a range of domains and technologies.
                    Most recently I've been building full stack Node.js microservices to help teachers and schools at Tes.
                    In the last year I've been leading teams of four to seven engineers working across multiple locations and timezones.
                    I've helped to build a remote-first culture through mentoring and coaching individuals and teams.
                    I'm happiest helping teams work together and building great products.

                            A large part of my job is mentoring and enabling individuals to be more effective.

                            We build services that look after high-risk and special category data.
                            We consider risk in everything we do and ensure necessary security measures are in place.
                            We take a lean approach to product development in order to get products in front of users quickly.

                        <p>I was a consultant developer on the following projects:</p>
                        <ul>

                                <p>Part of a team in Hamburg and Dusseldorf developing a web application for METRO Sales Managers to plan and manage customer visits.
                                    The system consists of a Java backend with a Cassandra database and a front end React service.
                                    I was also personally resonsible for the deployment pipeline of the application to Google Cloud using Kubernetes and Docker.

                                <p>I worked on the GOV UK Verify project which provides a single, secure way for individuals to access government services online.
                                    The system consists of numerous microservices written in Java using the Dropwizard framework.
                                    To ensure security, messages between these microservices and external systems use SAML.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This involves working in a support role for one week every month.
                                    This includes speaking with different third parties, releasing to test and production environments daily, and solving problems that arise in production.

                                <p>I worked on a small team at the Government Digital Service to build a prototype in Clojure to investigate a single sign-in service for the government for businesses.
                                    This included investigating the OpenID Connect protocol and implementing this in Clojure.
                                    I gave a talk about this project at the Clojure Xchange conference in December 2014.

                        <p><i>July 2011 - March 2014</i></p>
                        <p>
                        I was part of a team that interfaced with BT to provide telephone and broadband services to Sky customers.
                        Development was mainly in Java writing to an Oracle database and communicating using XML via an ActiveMQ message broker.
                        I worked on a mixture of legacy systems using Spring and Hibernate, and newer, more lightweight systems designed around business events.
                        I enjoyed using functional libraries such as Guava and Totally Lazy to make transforming collections simple and elegant.
                        I also developed a small Scala application, and found Scalaâ€™s support for overloading operators to be perfect for creating a simple DSL to route messages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This was an Agile environment: pair programming was standard, using a test driven development approach and starting from an acceptance test to define the business requirement.
                        I led numerous retrospectives for other teams and believe that effective communication is key to making a team work well.
