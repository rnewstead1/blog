<h2>North Downs Way 50 mile Race</h2> 

It's early.<br/>
I'm ready to run<br/>
Am I ready to race?<br/>
It's been so long.<br/>
A knee operation<br/>
A pandemic<br/>
I don't know what I'm doing any more<br/>
James tells me there are 2 ladies down the road<br/>
I start

I ran this trail before the pandemic<br/>
The ground feels familiar<br/>
The sensation in my stomach does not<br/>
Butterflies<br/>
I sing Eminem to myself<br/>
My breathing is shallow<br/>
I try to relax<br/>
I've missed this.

An aid station<br/>
People cheering!<br/>
What a great feeling<br/>
I cruise through<br/>
I feel ok<br/>
I feel amazing<br/>
Forests of bluebells<br/>
The smell of wild garlic<br/>
I think of Aisling<br/>
She'd like this trail

Mile 13 is hard<br/>
Am I going too fast<br/>
Or not fast enough?<br/>
This shouldn't feel hard<br/>
Ry flies past in Helios<br/>
I'm envious<br/>
My steps feel heavy<br/>
Maybe in Helios I would fly too

Aid stations are hard<br/>
Hands slick from sanitizer can't open bottles<br/>
Can't turn the tap off<br/>
I remember eating chips at Newlands Corner<br/>
And trampling mud into the cafe<br/>
Back in a different world where you could go to a cafe and relax

The endless trail to Denbie's<br/>
Sue is a surprise and a delight<br/>
Memories of Heathside rabbling on muddy hills<br/>
Much like this<br/>
But I'm much more tired<br/>
I remember racing through vineyards in the rain<br/>
Up one row<br/>
Down the next

We double back to the underpass<br/>
Why didn't they put it closer to Box Hill?<br/>
I'm not fast on the road<br/>
I think I used to be faster<br/>
At least I should be good at hills<br/>
I'm not good at steps<br/>

Up, down.<br/>
Up, down.<br/>
I see Caroline out for a run<br/>
We both double take<br/>
It's a small running world<br/>
More supporters on the hill<br/>
<i>"It's Rachel from Scotland!"</i><br/>
Thank you.<br/>
Thank you for being here.

I used to run cross country in Reigate.<br/>
It's as muddy as I remember<br/>
The views stretch for miles<br/>
Rolling fields<br/>
Shades of green<br/>
This is the England I remember<br/>
This is why I keep running<br/>
Mile 32 and James says I'm doing well<br/>
I don't believe him

Flat coke has given me a speed boost<br/>
I stretch out downhill<br/>
I zigzag with a few guys<br/>
They run away from me in the villages<br/>
I'm not fast on flat roads

I'm tired<br/>
And my legs feel sore<br/>
But I felt worse at mile 13<br/>
So I may as well keep going

School buildings and astroturfs<br/>
Who invented astroturf?<br/>
Why is it covered in sand?<br/>
Does Mike Lebowski blink or wink?<br/>
So many questions

I've abandoned my time goal<br/>
I just want to finish<br/>
I'm glad I kept my goal to myself<br/>
But maybe I'm my own worst critic

I reach the final checkpoint<br/>
Seven miles to go<br/>
I plod on<br/>
Just keep running<br/>
No excuses<br/>
I think of Chiara<br/>
She wouldn't flinch.

I get into a rhythm with a chant:<br/>
"Clear eyes<br/>
Full hearts<br/>
Can't lose"

In one field<br/>
Out another<br/>
I wait at a kissing gate<br/>
A lady and a dog can't decide<br/>
<i>"It's fine, no rush"</i><br/>
Not true<br/>
I can't stop<br/>
Don't let me stop<br/>
I can't think yet

Time has slowed down<br/>
I slip and slide through muddy puddles<br/>
Puddy muddles<br/>
My head feels muddled<br/>
When can I stop?

Mile 49 and I can see the finish arch<br/>
Always finish strong<br/>
I remember to smile<br/>
It's done
