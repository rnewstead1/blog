Recently I discovered the amazing collection of poetry - [Run Wild and Be, by Sydney Zester](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Run-Wild-Be-collection-endurance/dp/1798405709/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g1285150262) and her new book [Rituals](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Rituals-research-inspired-maddening-advocate/dp/B0874JFFBT/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=rituals+sydney+zester&qid=1590563801&s=books&sr=1-1). I've never been particuarly interested in poetry but these books are beautiful and so many of the verses I treasure and relate to.

These are my 3 favourites from Run Wild and Be:

_Day 1 of Forever_

<!-- end -->

The one about hill reps and rest and needing to do both.

??

It has inspired me to start thinking of my own verses when I'm moving in the hills.

_Water of Leith_

The air sits heavy
Pregnant under the sweat
Of all the new adventurers
Desperate for their fix.

_You_

When I'm with you
I run up the hills
At least I know
The weakness is my mind
Not my legs.
