        I used to be a runner<br/>
        Fast and fit and strong,<br/>
        Now I'm getting older<br/>
        And I'm getting fat.<br/>
        The midwife said stay active<br/>
        So I keep on shuffling on,<br/>
        But every day gets harder<br/>
        To move my bump along.<br/>
        <br/>
        I used to be a runner<br/>
        And dance nimbly down the hills,<br/>
        Now I jiggle with every step<br/>
        And prefer going up instead.<br/>
        Then I lean into each puff<br/>
        Let my bump lead the way;<br/>
        I waddle like a hippo<br/>
        But it blows the cobwebs away!
