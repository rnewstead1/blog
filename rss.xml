Each hour of the event, we will reveal how many miles you will have to cover that hour.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lockdown in Scotland ended early which meant we could have driven somewhere new and exciting to run.
But after being in one place for the last seven months we favoured comfort and familiarity and the ease of returning home every hour.
We didn&apos;t consider that this would make it much harder to get back out later in the day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent Friday baking and preparing snacks: rice cakes and polenta cakes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedzonecookbook.com/portables/&quot;&gt;Feed Zone Portables&lt;/a&gt;, sweet potato cookies from &lt;a href=&quot;https://runfasteatslow.com/pages/books&quot;&gt;Run Fast Eat Slow&lt;/a&gt;, savoury muffins and sweet muffins from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steampunkcoffee.co.uk/collections/gift-ideas-1/products/recipes-for-happiness-preorder&quot;&gt;Steam Punk recipe book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/24488/chilli-cheese-flapjacks.aspx&quot;&gt;cheese flapjacks&lt;/a&gt;.
A scallion pancake that was a disaster - it was basically just flour and water that I didn&apos;t roll thin enough.
We threw the undercooked dough straight in the bin!
I planned loops of different distances from the house.
In my head it was going to be a big snack party, with some running in between.
During the week I test-ran a few of my loops and tried to imagine going back out to do another after a short rest.
I couldn&apos;t visualise it.
I realised it was going to be quite a challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started at 8am with &lt;strong&gt;5 miles&lt;/strong&gt;.
To make the most of the early hour we both ran along the canal.
I ran in towards town, knowing it would be too busy to do so later.
Will ran in the opposite direction - we didn&apos;t want to run together early on as we were running quite different races!
I knew I&apos;d get carried away and try to keep up with him, which would likely bite me later in the day.
The sun was already shining and there were a few dog walkers and rowers about, all smiling at each other as we greeted the day.
There was a cold breeze from the east, making my first few miles a push into a headwind.
But it&apos;s hard to run slowly on the canal, especially when you&apos;re feeling fresh after an easy week!
Will beat me home by a few minutes and we took on some water while we waited for our next text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 miles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set off together again to do a loop along the Water of Leith and Woodhall Road.
Will went up West Mill road for a clockwise loop while I stayed on the Water of Leith to go anti-clockwise.
I crossed Gintas coming under the bypass.
I&apos;d talked him into the 6 hour Exposure and he&apos;d planned a 6 hour adventure round Edinburgh, seeing where he would end up at the end of each Exposure!
I crossed Will as I climbed the steps to Blinkbonny.
After an uphill start I enjoyed the rolling downhill miles towards home and arrived home shortly after Will again.
We were both feeling good and had espressos to celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure 3 was &lt;strong&gt;5 miles&lt;/strong&gt;.
For this one we both put podcasts on and ran towards Craiglockhart.
I caught up with Will at the traffic lights, dodging cars to cross the road.
The route was hilly: we ran up and around the side of Wester Craiglockhart hill and it was hard work to maintain a good pace.
This was a small dillema for a virtual race from home.
Most of the interesting runs from our house are hilly, but that wasn&apos;t practical for when we were trying to get back well inside an hour.
It meant we spent a lot more time running on tarmac than usual!
This loop came in slightly under distance as we approached our road, so we split up to lap up and down nearby streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was another &lt;strong&gt;6 miles&lt;/strong&gt;.
This time Will and I set off in opposite directions from each other.
I went through Hailes Quarry Park, then followed the cycle path through Stenhouse to the Jenners factory and joined the Water of Leith.
I sidestepped through the crowds of people playing in the sunshine in Saughton skate park and dashed across Gorgie Road.
This time I beat Will back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure 5 was only &lt;strong&gt;4 miles&lt;/strong&gt; and I ran a short loop on the Water of Leith, Woodhall Road and Lanark Road.
Running back down Lanark Road I found it hard to control my speed down the hill and clocked my only sub-7 minute mile for the 12 hours!
Will had done a loop through Colinton and I caught up with him on the downhill as we turned for home.
We had a decent rest before the next Exposure, but were both feeling tired from the heat and from running fast.
I tried a red lentil rice cake but it was disappointingly bland and the texture was gloopy.
I won&apos;t make those again!
We agreed that this was a very hard challenge.
I was jealous that Will had only one Exposure left.
Why had I signed up for 12 hours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure 6 was &lt;strong&gt;5 miles&lt;/strong&gt;.
We were both struggling so set off together for an easy out and back on the Water of Leith.
The trail is sheltered from the wind.
The way out is uphill but that means an easier run back when you&apos;re more tired (at least this is what I always tell myself).
It gets super busy at the weekend with families and dogs but in most places the trail is wide enough to hop to the side and overtake.
I&apos;d assumed I&apos;d get left behind but Will soon dropped behind me.
By the Colinton tunnel I couldn&apos;t see him at all.
I could hear the echo of his footsteps slapping the tarmac through the tunnel.
His steps sounded tired!
The half mile before the turnaround felt like a lot of effort.
I followed the diversion onto the main road and continued along there until it was time to turn, sidestepping people and parked cars.
Luckily I was motivated by the thought of the downhill.
It&apos;s barely noticeable to look at but when I run intervals here I run substantially faster on the way back because the slight gradient makes me feel like I&apos;m flying!
Coming back through the tunnel I spotted a guy running towards me wearing an Exposure race bib, but there was no time to say hello or even wave.
As usual the tunnel was full of people standing around reading and photographing the mural, unaware of anyone passing through.
Luckily I&apos;ve danced through this tunnel enough times in the last year to barely break stride.
The last mile was definitely a slog and the uphill to home felt like climbing a mountain.
Will returned a good 10 minutes later looking slightly shell-shocked.
It had been a long shuffle for him, but he&apos;d just run the furthest he&apos;d ever run in a day!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was feeling slightly broken and not sure if I could continue.
Luckily the best text message came through with the mileage for Exposure 7 - &lt;strong&gt;1 mile&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could run 1 mile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revived by that positive thought I headed out to the canal and managed to run a mile in under 8 minutes.
Now I needed to recover before what was sure to be a big next Exposure!
I ate a bagel and a cheese flapjack and lay on the floor with my legs up against the wall.
My legs were twitchy.
My back was chafed and my toes were blistered.
I felt like a wreck and there were still five Exposures left!
My heart was racing so I focused on slowing down my breathing, closing my eyes, and trying to relax.
With 15 minutes to go I got up and changed my clothes and shoes, and had another espresso while I waited for the next text to come through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 miles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will told me I could do it and suggested I run out and back along Lanark Road.
I had no better ideas, and hadn&apos;t done that yet, so I agreed.
The first mile to the traffic lights is a slow and painful uphill slog on the best of days.
Today at least the wind was on my side.
After the traffic lights I settled into the run and felt much better by the turnaround.
I took the final downhill mile a lot slower than usual but still finished in a respectable time.
The afternoon was roasting and I changed my top again and had a rehydration sachet, then put my legs up again for another ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure 9 was &lt;strong&gt;3 miles&lt;/strong&gt;.
I headed out feeling ok and ran along the canal to Hailes Quarry Park for a few loops.
After the first two miles I suddenly felt terrible and slowed down to a trot.
I made it back home but didn&apos;t feel good at all.
I was shivering despite the heat and put a down jacket on as soon as I got through the door.
I tried eating a polenta cake (it tasted much better than the rice cake, but it was not what I wanted at this point).
Will gave me some mini cheddars which tasted like the most amazing food ever!
Then the text I had been dreading came through: the next Exposure was &lt;strong&gt;6 miles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can&apos;t do it&lt;/em&gt;, I told Will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told me I had to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go. Shuffle. You got this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I shuffled out and down to the Water of Leith, planning to run the revers of the 6 mile loop I&apos;d run on Exposure 2.
This meant the climb came shortly after the first mile.
I made a pitiful attempt to run it but soon resorted to a march.
Luckily the climb is short but steep, so running up it isn&apos;t much quicker than walking.
However I was finding walking a bit of a challenge too.
I had to grab hold of a tree and use it to haul myself up the hill.
Last time I had to grab hold of that particular tree was when I crashed into it on my snowboard earlier this year.
At least this time it was helpful!
I managed to start running again at the top.
I shuffled through Campbell Park, onto Woodhall Road and through to Blinkbonny.
As I rejoined the road I saw it climbing up and away from me and couldn&apos;t face another climb, so turned downhill instead!
I shuffled back along the Water of Leith to the canal junction, and had to walk the uphill to the bridge over Lanark Road.
Then I had to walk again up Arnott Gardens.
I tried to make myself feel better by reminding myself that I have to push my single speed up this road when it&apos;s windy!
Unfortunately I still had another half mile to run so I had a slow plod up and down the road till my watch finally beeped for 6 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Exposure 10 had taken me 55 minutes I had little time to spare and had already received my text for the next hour.
&lt;strong&gt;2 miles&lt;/strong&gt;.
Remembering the magic powers coke can have during an ultramarathon I drank most of a can, hoping that the sugar and caffeine would save me.
After a 10 minute rest I went back out.
I ran a mile out and a mile back along the canal and felt a lot better than I had on the last Exposure.
I tried to focus on just those 2 miles and not think about what the final hour would bring.
Back home again I finished my coke and lay back on the floor again.
By now straightening my legs was too painful so I elevated them on a gym ball.
I was still shivery and my legs were still shaking.
My body was trying to tell me to stop.
Will gave me some hot water to warm me up.
My friends messaged with encouragement for the final Exposure.
I waited fearfully for the text, trying to mentally prepare for a big number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;strong&gt;4 miles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to my route board and picked a 4 mile route I hadn&apos;t yet run.
It meant a big push uphill to start, but then some flat and downhill running and a flat last mile along the canal.
I pulled myself together and put my headphones in and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0jbx2LsInVAAIhhu6XXLXj?si=PuXoG1Z-QBmxl1P9vV9EUw&quot;&gt;Shoot Your Shot SWAP playlist&lt;/a&gt; on.
I staggered outside for the final time.
Knowing that the first mile was uphill and going to be horrible somehow made it easier.
I plodded along focusing on my music and blocking out the cars hurtling past.
I endured the first mile and then I knew I would be ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streets of Baberton were bathed in the evening sunshine, and I enjoyed a glorious downhill to the canal at Wester Hailes.
I knew it was still a misleadingly long way home.
The buildings and bridges along the canal all look the same here so the trick is to assume there&apos;s always another corner to go around.
Eventually you are pleasantly surprised!
I felt almost euphoric as I ran along in a semi-dehydrated haze.
Probably not the best state to be in running through Wester Hailes on a Saturday evening, but there weren&apos;t many people around!
Finally I reached the level crossing at Kingsknowe.
I&apos;d been avoiding this all day in case it shut as I arrived.
Now I felt lucky, and besides, it wouldn&apos;t be a disaster if I had to finish the final Exposure somewhere other than home.
Upon thinking that I realised it wasn&apos;t true.
I wanted to finish at home very much.
I was looking forward to laying down and not needing to get up and run again!
Anyway I was lucky and the barriers were up.
I ran up the final small hill.
I&apos;d hoped for a glorious, triumphant run in to finish in front of my house, but life is messy and I had to run 0.2 miles further!
I ran up and down the street a few more times.
I don&apos;t know what the neighbours thought as they watched me stagger out of my house and limp into a run every hour, and shuffle back up and down when I returned!
Extra distance done, my watch finally beeped outside my house and I collapsed inside.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few days were a struggle.
I needed assistance to get up from sitting down and to get down the stairs.
My quads felt like I ran a hard road marathon.
My hamstrings and ankles were sore and my toes blistered and bleeding.
It was a great feeling after over a year without racing!
Despite being a virtual event it felt like being part of something bigger.
There was a real thrill coming back and checking the leaderboard every hour and waiting for the next text!
It was a unique event and I although I probably started a bit fast, I don&apos;t know that I&apos;d run it any differently.
I found the rest periods hard to manage and I let myself stiffen up during these which made it hard to start running again.
Usually in a long race my mantra is &lt;em&gt;keep on moving&lt;/em&gt;, so this was very different.
Usually you don&apos;t have the time during a race to realise you have blisters and chafing!
There was a lot of recovery time where I had to not let my mind or body think it could stop.
Luckily my self-talk was a lot more positive than it had been at my last long race (&lt;a href=&quot;https://powderach.com/posts/lavaredo-120km&quot;&gt;Lavaredo&lt;/a&gt;).
This time I told myself &lt;em&gt;you got this&lt;/em&gt;, rather than doubt myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surrender is your only option&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from a dark 10th Exposure, I had a positive experience, and I&apos;m now excited about more racing this summer.
Thanks to the Pyllon crew for a fun and impeccably organised event.
I look forward to the next one!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[On motivation]]></title><description><![CDATA[it's just a run  Lately I haven't wanted to run.

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It snowed again and I enjoyed a few glorious days snowboarding in the local hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too soon the snow melted and now it feels like spring.
The mornings and evenings are lighter.
But I don&apos;t get up early and I work till late.
I make excuses because I don&apos;t want to run.
The global situation feels heavy on my shoulders.
I know I&apos;m privileged and I shouldn&apos;t complain, but the weight of being in one place for so long is wearing me down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s ok.
It&apos;s ok I don&apos;t want to leave my house when it&apos;s wet, windy and cold.
Why would I, when inside is cosy and warm?
It&apos;s ok I don&apos;t want to leave when it&apos;s sunny outside.
I am safe and comfortable inside.
It&apos;s ok I don&apos;t want to, because I always do in the end.
I put on my shoes and head out the door.
I tell myself: &lt;em&gt;it&apos;s just a run&lt;/em&gt;.
Most of the time I enjoy it.
I certainly enjoy the feeling after I get back.
I love the fresh air and the endorphins.
Being outside makes you feel good.
I feel proud of myself for having the discipline to get out and run when I didn&apos;t want to.
I look forward to the days when I do want to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s the thing with motivation.
Like the karma chameleon, it comes and goes.
Discipline is what gets me out the door when I don&apos;t feel like it.
Discipline will keep me going until my motivation returns.
From now on I&apos;m going to focus more on discipline.
And I&apos;m going to keep reminding myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;it&apos;s just a run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There are lots of suggestions on how to run a workshop like this on the internet.
I picked one that would work well remotely.
Everyone created their own values board individually, and we had time at the beginning and end for discussion to make the sesion more interactive.
The workshop fit into a one hour session but some of the discussions felt a little rushed, so longer would probably be better.
I encouraged people to take extra time to reflect afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started by discussing what personal values are, and why they are important.
We used this definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values are basic and fundamental beliefs that guide or motivate attitudes or actions. They help us to determine what is important to us. Values describe the personal qualities we choose to embody to guide our actions; the sort of person we want to be; the manner in which we treat ourselves and others, and our interaction with the world around us. They provide the general guidelines for conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When aligning with our values we tend to feel more energetic, positive, and live with clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people created their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/&quot;&gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt; board from a template I&apos;d created.
But you don&apos;t need a template or Miro - you just need 10 post-it notes.&lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start by writing down 10 values that are important to you, one on each post-it note.&lt;/strong&gt;
You can look at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-core-values.html&quot;&gt;list of examples&lt;/a&gt; for ideas if it helps.
But don&apos;t let the list restrict you!
There is no right or wrong answer.
Each value should be important to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.
It&apos;s ok for this first part to take a while.
We only spent 5 minutes on this and some people felt a little rushed.
The timings for the next stages are strict, so take some extra time here to ensure everyone feels comfortable with their 10 values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next refine the values.&lt;/strong&gt;
You have 30 seconds to discard the 3 &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; important values of those you wrote down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refine again.&lt;/strong&gt;
Now you have 20 seconds to discard 2 more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And again.&lt;/strong&gt;
For the last time, take 20 seconds to discard 2 more. This is meant to be hard!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The values remaining are your 3 core values.&lt;/strong&gt;
You might want to reword them or better define what they mean to you, and add notes about why you chose them.
Maybe you discarded something because it was encompassed by one of your remaining values: is there a word or phrase that would better express both?
If you feel super uncomfortable about one of your last discards it&apos;s ok to bring it back in.
Having 3 - 5 core values is best. More than this would be too many to try and live by. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have your values, discuss the following questions as a group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I feel about the values I ended up with?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were they as expected or did they surprise me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do these values show themselves in my everyday life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What actions do I already take to live by them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What actions would I like to take to live by them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finish up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your values are not static and are likely to change over time.
They should be memorable and things that you feel strongly about at your core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this exercise very powerful.
I ended up with the following values:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realising these were the values most important to me helped me identify things in my life that were in direct conflict with these values.
Before I&apos;d been feeling a deep sense of discomfort and couldn&apos;t put my finger on why.
Having a clear set of values helped me better articulate what I was feeling, and then change the situation.
Since doing this exercise I&apos;ve left a job that had become bad for me.
I&apos;ve started somewhere new where I feel aligned with the values of my team and company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got out early Saturday morning with ski touring kit before the temperature rose and lots of the snow melted. It was cold and windy and we were very glad to be wearing full ski gear and goggles!&lt;/p&gt;

I signed up to run 100 miles in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve run 100 mile weeks before when peak ultra training, but I&apos;m definitely not in that shape at the moment! Here&apos;s how it went... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the week off to a good start I did my first run before work. Road shoes on, along the canal. It was cold and harder than I expected.
I was full of self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When did I last run on the road? Am I going too fast? When did I last wear road shoes? Should I slow down? I should slow down...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I got home my right calf was sore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work I set out for another 4 miles on the road.
It was raining and windy, but the first mile was downhill with the wind behind me.
It should have felt easy.
It didn&apos;t. When I turned into the wind I was already cursing. I slowly crawled to the top of the hill.
Another runner overtook me as I neared the top. He looked super smooth. The hill wasn&apos;t bothering him.
I sped up as I turned for the final downhill, more to prove to myself that I could than anything else.
But now on the opposite side of the road from the other runner I sped up until I drew level with him and suddenly felt silly and embarassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not sure I could do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ignored my alarm. There would be no run before work.
I had back-to-back meetings all morning and by the time I finally left for a run at lunch time I was felt panicky.
I was taking on too much.
This week I needed to do quarterly reviews for my team, organise an openspace for next week and work through a team reshuffle.
I was only working 3 days in a desperate final bid to use up my holiday for the year (totally my fault and terrible planning!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was I also trying to run 100 miles this week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set out feeling angry and frustrated - at work, at myself, at the world. I forgot to start my watch.
I could feel myself tearing up but I fought back the tears.
I focused on breathing and putting one foot in front of the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran along the Water of Leith trail in light trail shoes.
By mile 3 I was running through fields at the edge of the Pentlands and next to some reservoirs.
I had the trails to myself and I felt calm again.
It was just running. I could do this, one run at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clearer head helped an afternoon of meetings and I felt positive when I set out for my second run.
I met Gintas on the Water of Leith and we settled into an easy chatting pace.
We stayed low, looped round the trails at Heriot-Watt and back along the canal.
Finally running felt easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25/100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will and I headed out early on an easy loop of the Water of Leith, Poet&apos;s Glen and a couple of reservoirs.
My calf pain was gone and I felt good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not officially working I had a few calls in the middle of the day so missed most of the sunshine.
I headed back out just before it got dark and weaved through Craiglockhart and the Hermitage.
The trail there was as muddy as the Water of Leith, but not busy.
I listened to the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/6yS7HKyqjnlFSCFj7kWqwG?si=orzfkyyyTCaEzctAWqqCyw&quot;&gt;Some Work All Play podcast&lt;/a&gt;, letting the infectious enthusiasm of David and Megan Roche wash over and inspire me.
I wiggled around the edge of Holyrood Park to Aisling&apos;s house.
We chatted outside at a bus stop, unintentionally confusing poor Fern who couldn&apos;t understand why we weren&apos;t taking her to the park.
I dodged crowds of people in town and the Meadows on the way home, avoiding the canal until I was a few miles out of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;48/100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting the day with a half hour pilates class made my aching hips and legs feel new again!
I planned for an easy day with a seven mile run at lunch.
But I started working at 08:30 and bounced between reviews and frantically trying to finish slides for a presentation in the afternoon (check them out &lt;a href=&quot;https://rnewstead1.github.io/presentations/worker-threads.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you&apos;re interested in learning about worker threads in Node.js).
At midday I realised there was no way I had time for a run, and shifted it to after work.
Presentation done, reviews done, I could relax, and set out into the dark for another Poet&apos;s Glen loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;55/100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day off, but I was up early for a meeting.
The follow-up calls and notes took longer than I&apos;d anticipated and I left the house later than planned.
I rode my single-speed up and over Costorphine to Dalmeny and left my bike at the station.
The current covid restrictions meant I could leave Edinburgh for informal exercise as long as it started and finished in the same place.
We had no desire to push the boundaries of the rules but Neil and I agreed this allowed us to run together (he lives in Fife).
I was looking forward to having company on my longest run of the week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We planned to meet in the middle of the Forth Road Bridge but I confused left and right and ended up at a roundabout with no idea where I was.
I backtracked and picked up the cycle path and eventually collided (not literally, we kept our distance) with Neil.
He led me on a tour of Fife through Inverkeithing and Dalgety Bay to Aberdour, and back along the coastal path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to see somewhere different. Plus it&apos;s always sunny in Fife.
We parted on the bridge and I staggered back to my bike, hips sore from all the tarmac pounding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the cycle home I wished for gears as I wobbled all over the road up Drum Brae Hill, crunching the pedals and ignoring my screaming quads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;77/100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt tired after Friday&apos;s long run and delayed running until it was almost sunset.
I headed out via Heriot-Watt then up Poet&apos;s Glen, through the farm and back along the road.
The end was in sight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;86/100&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing I would complete the challenge didn&apos;t make it any easier to get out the door.
Simply getting out of bed was difficult.
Will was keen to run but my lack of enthusiasm was dragging him down so I encouraged him to go out alone.
I let myself laze around for another hour and then pulled myself together.
I listened to a podcast which cheered me up immensely - &lt;a href=&quot;https://brenebrown.com/podcast/brene-with-jason-sudeikis-brendan-hunt-on-ted-lasso/&quot;&gt;Brene Brown interviewing Jason Suedeikis and Brendan Hunt about Ted Lasso&lt;/a&gt;.
When the podcast finished I had settled into the run and was approaching the hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were sitting in cloud with the summits peaking through. I was excited to get above the cloud before it passed!
As I hiked uphill my legs felt surprisingly good.
After a week of avoiding the hills I missed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views over the city from the first summit of Caerketton were tremendous.
I ran over Allemuir, Capelaw and Harbour Hill before descending to Ranges Road, and home via the reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran one hundred miles in a week and it felt hard.
I&apos;ve done this before, but this felt much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all my races cancelled this year I&apos;ve struggled for motivation to get out the door.
I&apos;ve let life stress take over.
I&apos;ve doubted myself - my fitness and my worth - on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I still a runner if I don&apos;t race? If I don&apos;t set a new FKT?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt; of course.
Certainly that&apos;s what I&apos;d say to anyone else who asked that question, or had similar doubts.
Deep down I know it, but sometimes I find it hard to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared my self doubt with my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aycyang&quot;&gt;Amy&lt;/a&gt; this week and after talking through things I realised my intention.
Next year I want to run 100 miles in one go.
Hopefully the &lt;a href=&quot;https://westhighlandwayrace.org/&quot;&gt;West Highland Way race&lt;/a&gt; will go ahead and I can run that* as it already means so much to me.
If it doesn&apos;t, I will pick a (appropriate to any restrictions) route and run the distance myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* in this case 96 miles === 100 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I believe in hope. I believe in believe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a while to get used to riding our bikes with all the bags on! We&apos;d run the first section from Drumnadrochit a few days before and knew that the main trail was closed for the first three or four miles. The diversion was a push up a steep hill and then narrow uphill single track that we just managed to stay on our bikes for. After this we rejoined the real trail on a big descent. This was the first downhill I&apos;d done with all the kit on the bike and I had to really force myself to relax. My saddle was higher than I was used to to provide enough clearance for my saddle bag. This meant I couldn&apos;t get my weight as far back as I would usually on a downhill, but the weight of my saddle bag meant I didn&apos;t need to, and the bike stayed balanced nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely ride to Corrimony on quiet gravel forestry tracks. Then we joined a road and had a very cold descent to Carrich before rejoining forestry tracks. The sun was shining and the path was undulating and we made great progress. I&apos;d estimated we&apos;d average 5 miles in 45 minutes, and we&apos;d matched that for the first 15 miles after our slow start, but the next 15 miles flew by on easy gravel trails. After a steep winding descent to a car park full of midges at Dog Falls, we climbed and descended some more and enjoyed bumping along high above Loch Beinn a&apos; Mheadhoin and then Loch Affric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed the (closed) youth hostel at Alltbeithe and from there the going got a lot tougher. It was very wet underfoot and the gravel path turned into grassy bog. We rode where we could and pushed where we couldn&apos;t. The bikes were heavy with the bags and pushing was hard work! We made very slow progress and soon became disheartened. The terrain became more remote and more extreme, with steep rocky sections to climb. At one point I tried to ride down a steep bit, got the front wheel stuck and went in slow motion over the handlebars, landing hard on my knee. After that I was scared to try to ride any steep descents! We were planning to camp somewhere near the end of the trail but after taking three hours to cover the last 10 miles we decided to call it a day. We dragged the bikes down a steep descent and found a flat place to camp near the River Croe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within seconds of stopping the midges were upon us. We put the tent up with our midge nets on. Unfortunately this took a long time as we hadn&apos;t put the tent up before - somehow the grand plan of trying it out in the living room the week before had never been realised. Eventually it was pitched and we took it in turns to change into long leggings and warm clothes in the tent, and Will bravely boiled some water on the stove for dinner. We retreated to the tent and spent a good five minutes stamping on all the midges that had got in. There were thousands of them! We realised the disadvantage of camping in Scotland in the summer. We were in a beautiful location but there were too many midges to sit outside and enoy it! Our tent is great for backpacking as it&apos;s very small a light, but it&apos;s not the most comfortable place to spend the whole evening in! But I got warm and snug inside my sleeping bag and ate dinner from there and started reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annamcnuff.com/books/&quot;&gt;Anna McNuff&apos;s new book&lt;/a&gt;, Llama Drama, about cycling along the Andes. Within minutes I was chuckling to myself and feeling better about the fact that we had taken so long to cover the last section - it was all part of the adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a restless night being paranoid about midges and all too soon the alarm went off. The midges were slighly less aggressive in the morning and we are breakfast marching around to try and lose them, then found a windy spot to pack our bags in. We set off to finish the trail. After the first half mile the trail turned to farm track and it was easy riding to Morvich and the end of the Affric Kintail Way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before we&apos;d decided that we couldn&apos;t face the big push that awaited us back to Alltbeithe, so instead took the road through Glen Shiel. Unfortunately this is the A87: the main route from Fort William to Skye. It was super busy with cars and lorries flying past too close and too fast. We rode in tight formation, each taking our turn on the front, averaging 15 miles per hour on our loaded mountain bikes! We stopped for second breakfast and some respite from the traffic at The Cluanie Inn. The fast and furious pace continued all the way to Invermoriston on Loch Ness where we were relieved to leave the road and join the Great Glen Way for the final push back to Drumnadrochit. Initially this was a shock as we turned onto a single track winding road that was so steep we had to get off and push! By this point we both had very tired legs. Thankfully we turned on to gravel tracks which traversed along above Loch Ness and finished with some splendid single track a few miles out of Drumnadrochit. From here it was a slow roll along some quiet country roads back to the van.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cairngorm 4000s]]></title><description><![CDATA[The day we planned to run the Cairngorm 4000s our van broke down in Perth.

&lt;p&gt;We parked half a mile from Glenmore Lodge and began by running up to it. From there the track was closed so we ended up back on the road. We briefly turned off onto a trail but found this too was closed due to a landslide! We failed to find an alternative trail after a short slog up a stream, and returned to the road again. At the ski centre we took a wide gravel track to the left of the restaurant and headed for the top of the (closed) furnicular. After this we joined the main track to the summit of Cairn Gorm which was surprisingly busy. We didn&apos;t know where all the people had started from as the track we&apos;d come up on had been empty! The summit of Cairn Gorm was sunny with splended views, but we didn&apos;t hang around as we were in short sleeves and the wind was cold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track to Ben Macdui was rocky and fun and we passed lots of people. The summit of Ben Macdui was busy and colder than the previous summit. I heard someone marvel that I was up there in just a skort and t-shirt, but I didn&apos;t feel very tough and soon after this we paused to put on jackets. There was no path down to the Lairig Ghru from Ben Macdui but we could clearly see where we were aiming for. To begin with we scrambled down rocks, which luckily felt solid and stable! Then we traversed around to the left to avoid some scree and found some grassier patches. These were less exposed and scary but it was even slower going as it was super steep and required a lot of concentration. When we&apos;d planned our day we thought this descent might take 40 minutes; in reality it took us almost two hours. We definitely didn&apos;t take the best line! Finally we made it down to the Lairig Ghru and stopped to eat lunch. My left leg was shaking - a sure sign that it&apos;s not yet as strong as the right post-op, but it was still coping admirably!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ascent of Cairn Toul was also without a path and was super steep. We followed a stream up and it was very midgey. I kept my head down and was glad of my peaked cap. I developed a rythym of wiping the midges from my face, then my neck, then arms, then back to my face again. They were everywhere. We climbed quickly and without much chat. We just wanted to escape from the midges. Higher up there was a light breeze and we stopped for a break and some sweets. We crested what looked like the top but were faced with a rocky scramble up to the ridge and summit. We did our best to pick a good line but the rocks felt loose and sketchy. I tried to tread as lightly as possible. When we finally reached the top we were surprised to see a few other people there. They&apos;d all come a more sensible way along a path!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the summit of Cairn Toul we followed the plateau around to the next two Munros: Sgor an Lochain Uaine and Braeriach. Braeriach still looked like a very long way away. However it was easy running, the views were stunning and weather was great so we had a fine time. The wind picked up as we reached the last summit, but we were glad as it meant the midges kept away. From Braeriach we descended back to the Lairig Ghru and a final climb to the Charlamain Gap. This was a fun scramble and we passed a lot of people who were also making their way down at the end of the day, and cheered us on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging from the Charlamain Gap we could see over to Loch Morlich in the distance. The last few miles seemed to stretch for a long time and we were both super tired by the time we eventually reached the van. It was a good tired, mingled with the satisfaction of an excellent day in the hills. We celebrated by ordering a takeaway pizza and eating it at Loch Morlich. Of course, being summer in Scotland, it was too midgey to sit down to enjoy it properly!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Three Lochs Way]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Three Lochs Way is a 34 mile marked trail from Balloch to Inveruglas, both on Loch Lomond, via the Gareloch and Loch Long.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a leisurely breakfast at my in-laws, I drove to Inveruglas, then rode 20 miles down the A82 on the west side of Loch Lomond on my single speed bike. Luckily it was fairly flat and there weren&apos;t too many cars, but I arrived in Balloch already feeling tired and sweaty. I was carrying a litre and a half of water and I hoped this would be enough. Here I made my first mistake as I should have taken a short rest and rehydrated so that I started the run in a calm mindset. But I got flustered by all the people hanging around at Balloch visitor centre and set off promptly, my feet still numb from the cycle. Ten minutes later I had to stop to re-lace my shoes and catch my breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Away from the crowds at Loch Lomond Shores I began the first climb out of town and was delighted to run into Karen who was finishing her morning run. She ran up the hill with me and I immediately felt better with someone to chat to. From the top of the hill there were great views out to Loch Lomond and fun forest trails. The descent into Helensburgh was excellent fun, very twisting and fast. Unfortunately my knee felt sore and my pack heavy and bouncing around. At this early stage I was already questioning why I was doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running into Helensburgh I weaved amongst the school children and wondered if I should buy some more water. I decided against it. I left the shore of the Gareloch and turned up through the town, heading up to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/the-hill-house&quot;&gt;Hill House&lt;/a&gt;, built by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Here I was back on familiar trails and enjoyed the run down to the old Glen Fruin road. This was now the section I&apos;d been dreading - road miles in the midday sun and heading uphill. I wasn&apos;t moving very fast and it seemed to take forever. I was relieved to finally turn off the road but by this point I was rationing my remaining water. The next section was on military road and felt a bit eerie. The road was very straight and quiet, with signs on either side warning you not to touch suspicious objects. I could see down to the base at Faslane and was wary of taking any photos around here in case someone suddenly appeared to stop me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Garelochhead the road became trail and headed up again. I considered detouring to Garelochhead to get water, but it was over a mile away so didn&apos;t seem worth it. There were a few stream crossings and I doused myself in water (but didn&apos;t dare drink any). It helped cool me down a bit. This section was the most picturesque, with great views out across Loch Long with the Arrochar Alps rising behind to the north. But by now all I could think about was water. I felt so tired and didn&apos;t want to run too fast because it made me feel more thirsty, so I took frequent walking breaks. Then I got annoyed at myself for not moving fast enough. I was also worried that by the time I eventually found a shop it would be so late it was shut!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally at mile 27 I descended into Tarbet and was overjoyed to find a small shop. I stumbled towards the entrance and was firmly stopped and told I needed to put on a mask. My hands were shaking as I found one in my bag. I&apos;d been so single track focused on getting water I&apos;d forgotten about a global pandemic. I bought a litre of water and a bottle of coke, and drank half the water and most of the coke straight away. Feeling a hundred times better I followed the trail left through the rail station and into the woods towards Arrochar at the head of Loch Long. The last time I&apos;d run this section there had been a diversion back onto the road, so I was pleased that the official route stayed on trail high in the woods. The path then turned north and headed back towards Loch Lomond, with the Arrochar Alps visible to the west. There were lots of small rises and I walked a lot of this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejoining a small road I knew it was all downhill to Loch Lomond and found some extra energy for a few faster miles at the end. I dropped down to the side of the loch and wound along the side of the road until I was back at the car. I was far too early to get to see John and made a plan to drive back out once I&apos;d showered and eaten. However the second I sat down I could barely keep my eyes open! My longest run of the year had certainly taken a lot out of me. In the event John didn&apos;t reach Inverbeg until the early hours of the next morning, and had to cycle up to Fort William in a storm. I was glad to be safely tucked up in bed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Three Lochs Way was a fun trail to run and I&apos;m keen to try it on a mountain bike next! I was pleased with how my body held up, but found the long day very hard work. And next time I&apos;ll definitely carry more water which will make the experience lots more enjoyable!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Water of Leith]]></title><description><![CDATA[Find another route]]></description><link>https://powderach.com/posts/water-of-leith</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://powderach.com/posts/water-of-leith</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Find another route&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was going to be a post about my trip to Gran Canaria at the end of February. I was meant to be running the marathon at Transgrancanaria but my knee operation meant that wasn&apos;t possible. I went on the trip anyway and enjoyed the race weekend cheering on some friends who were running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has changed dramatically since the end of February. I can&apos;t quite muster the energy to write in much detail about that past world. It feels like a lot longer ago than a few months. However looking back at the photos have cheered me up on this stormy Saturday, and helped me recall a great few weeks of training. It was before I was able to run post-operation, so I biked, swam, aqua-jogged and hiked. Since then my knee has recovered a lot and I&apos;m now running four times a week, but still enjoying riding my bike too. I&apos;m still finding my way in this new covid-19 world, establishing new routines and exploring from my front door. One of the big lessons of the year for me so far is appreciating slowing down and not always looking to the future and rushing on to the next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training when you can&apos;t run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started each day aqua-jogging in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hellocanaryislands.com/natural-pools/gran-canaria/las-salinas-de-agaete/&quot;&gt;sea pools at Agaete&lt;/a&gt;, ten minutes walk from where I was based. It was chilly before the sun came up and I was glad to have brought a shorty wetsuit with me. I aqua-jogged in laps around one of the larger pools, quickly establishing a line that would avoid sharp rocks on the bottom. I&apos;m a bit scared of what might be underneath me when in open water, so this was a great opportunity to face that fear every morning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a morning&apos;s work I had a quick swim at lunch time (it had to be quick because the water was freezing!) and then hiked up and down the nearest hill. After work every evening I rode my bike until it got dark. I hired a road bike for the first half of my stay, and a mountain bike for the rest, both from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Cyclo-Agaete-Bike-Rental-641591279633781/&quot;&gt;Cyclo Agaete Bike Rental&lt;/a&gt;. The bikes were excellent and the price very reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the roads were smooth and empty, with lots of big climbs. I could feel myself getting stronger each time I rode! Occasionally I&apos;d make a bad route choice: what I thought from Google maps was a proper road turned out to be a gravel track. One evening I narrowly beat the darkness home after wobbling precariously along dirt trails for miles on skinny road tyres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to have some great mountain bike trails right from my doorstep that weren&apos;t too technical. To begin with I was worried my knee wouldn&apos;t cope with downhill mountain biking, but my confidence (and strength) grew each day. My regular trail started with a 40 minute uphill slog in the sun. It was worth it for the views and the downhill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my last day of mountain biking I explored some new trails that were a bit too steep and technical for me. I fell hard on my elbow and ended up with a deep cut. Luckily it was towards the end of my ride, but gave a fright to the lady who was out walking her dog nearby. Her dog ran up to me and was jumping excitedly at me, while I held my bloody elbow in the air. I think she thought her dog had bitten me! It took a few weeks of removing bits of black sand from the cut when I was back home before it healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed south for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transgrancanaria.net/&quot;&gt;Transgrancanaria&lt;/a&gt; race weekend and cheered on some friends who were running. I hired another road bike (this time from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.free-motion.com/&quot;&gt;Free Motion&lt;/a&gt; in Maspalomas) and cycled a big hilly loop on race day, passing one of the race checkpoints three times.&lt;/p&gt;

She won the 30km race and was through so quickly I hadn&apos;t arrived yet! Another friend Katie had a great race in the marathon, finishing 5th amongst a very competitive Spanish field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been thinking for a while that right now I want to focus on solving people problems more than technical ones.
I’m also very interested in helping juniors develop and progress.
I was thrilled to be promoted at the end of last summer and proud to be the first female Principal Engineer here at Tes!
I wanted to make sure that I would do the best job I could for my team and the wider engineering team, so I asked some of the existing Principal Engineers for advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first and favourite piece of advice was from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gabceb&quot;&gt;Gabriel&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;always smile&lt;/strong&gt;.
I like to think about this when things get tough.
It helps to put work and what we do in perspective.
We believe in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive&quot;&gt;Retrospective Prime Directive&lt;/a&gt;, that everyone is doing the best job they can.
Mistakes happen and luckily we don’t work in a high-risk environment.
Things break and we fix them.
By focusing on the positives we can foster a safe environment where people don’t worry about being blamed if they make a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/boreplusplus&quot;&gt;Dalibor’s&lt;/a&gt; main tip was to &lt;strong&gt;keep the pulse of the people on your team&lt;/strong&gt;.
A lack of drama may not mean a lack of tension.
It can mean that there’s a lot of pent up tension.
As a leader you have to get a feel for this, which you do by talking to everyone and making sure that they are speaking to each other.
Communication is the base of what makes a good team.
Delivery, performance and everything else follows that.
Don’t be afraid of conflict: it can be healthy as it brings issues out into the open.
At Tes we value openness and honesty across our engineering team and want everyone to feel safe to speak their thoughts.
We have a lot of smart people but they don’t always agree.
And that’s ok - in fact this drives great ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cressie176&quot;&gt;Stephen&lt;/a&gt; said an important thing to remember is that &lt;strong&gt;often there is no right answer.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You just need a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; answer.&lt;/strong&gt;
When you need to make a decision, do so quickly and confidently, so that things can move on.
You can always change your mind after 3 months.
Doing something is better than doing nothing in the quest to work out the best thing to do.
Most of the time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegrowtheq.com/its-okay-to-be-good-and-not-great/&quot;&gt;&quot;consistently good enough beats great&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.
Don’t beat yourself up about not being perfect.
You will always get criticised for the decisions you make, but you will never know what would have happened if you&apos;d made a different decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge I found moving from Senior to Principal Engineer was the explosion of things I needed to do (or at least thought I did).
At the beginning I was naive enough to think I could still pick up chunky features or code refactors and get them done in a timely fashion.
I quickly learned I should only do that in a pair with someone who can continue to drive the work forwards when I inevitably get pulled into other things.
I have had to be strict with my diary and to-do lists so that I can get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While juggling many plates on a particularly busy day I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/twicezer0&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; a slightly different question than I’d asked other Principal Engineers: &quot;At some point I would like to have a conversation with you about how you manage 🤹‍️ without 🤯&quot;.
Dan’s answer, later immortalised in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/twicezer0/status/1219722474553847808&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, beautifully articulates lots of the advice I’d already been given:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also picked up some great tips about being a good leader at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://devternity.com/&quot;&gt;DevTernity&lt;/a&gt; conference at the end of last year.
Roy Osherove, who wrote the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1617293083/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;#x26;psc=1&quot;&gt;The Elastic Leader&lt;/a&gt; gave a talk titled The Coaching Architect Manifesto.
He said your goal as a leader is to try to grow your team.
&lt;strong&gt;You should try to make yourself unneeded and remove yourself as a bottleneck&lt;/strong&gt;.
Your team should be empowered enough to be confident in making decisions without you.
If you can do this well, you’ll always have a job.
This seems counter-intuitive, but it makes sense.
You will be seen as someone who can build a good team, which is an invaluable skill.
Management know that you can move to another team and do the same.
A good opportunity to help grow inidividuals on your team is when someone asks you what to do.
Rather than give the answer, turn it around and ask them what are they going to do?
This is the first step to get them solving their own problems.
Of course this won’t work in every situation, but it’s a good technique to consider.
Osherove pointed out that being a leader is not about making everyone like you.
People have to be uncomfortable to learn and grow.
This means you have to challenge people and they will not always like you for it (although if you do this well they should respect you for it).
At Tes we strive to create and nourish a safe environment so that people can be challenged at the right level.
It’s ok for a task to seem scary, but people need to feel safe to ask for help and not afraid to help.
As a leader it’s important to ensure people feel supported as they learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point applies to me as a leader too.
I have certainly felt challenged by my new role and the responsibilities that come with it.
But I feel supported by my team and the other Principal Engineers and know that as long as I’m doing my best, I will grow and become a better leader.
My key takeaway from all of my questioning and learning, is that &lt;strong&gt;you can’t do all the things all the time&lt;/strong&gt;.
Delegation helps, and so does prioritising.
But it also means accepting that some things may not get done at all.
As long as you’ve done a good job of prioritising, that’s ok!
I still have a lot to learn and I’m sure I’ll make lots of mistakes along the way.
But I’m excited about the journey!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Knees]]></title><description><![CDATA[For a long time now I've had a problem with my left knee.

I remember a winter session of military fitness a long time ago, running with a bib round my waist and someone using it to pull me back. I remember landing on my left foot and twisting, and sharp pain in my knee. It disrupted my training for the 2014 London marathon. I stopped running and went to see a physio. I was diagnosed with tight hips and weak glutes. Standard runner issues. Too much running, not enough strength work. I diligently did the physio exercises and swapped running for cycling. It recovered in time for me to resume training and run the marathon. But the underlying issue never fully went away and it&apos;s niggled off and on ever since. I accepted that I had a dodgy left knee and would avoid doing things to fully bend it - squat thrusts and sitting cross-legged in a certain way. It was sometimes a bit sore but crucially it didn&apos;t stop me running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first fell in love with ultramarathons I knew I needed to do something to avoid my knee getting sore again. In early 2017 I signed up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://improvemyrunning.com/&quot;&gt;Improve My Running&lt;/a&gt; to help me work on my running technique. From race photos I could see that that my left foot often comes inwards when I run. My right hip has a tendency to get very tight. I suspected the two were related and could all be part compensation for a weakness around my left knee. With Matt&apos;s help and working to make my glutes stronger, my form has improved dramatically and my foot only turns in when I&apos;m very tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good running form was not on my mind much during the 18+ hour sufferfest that was Laveredo in a heatwave last summer. I was certainly very tired and for the final few hours I was barely shuffling. After the race, my knee got sore again. I assumed that it would improve with some time off running. I rested through July and tried to return to running in August. Every time I tried to increase my mileage, my knee hurt. While at Loughborough University for a work event I spent an amazing few hours with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lboro.ac.uk/sport/physiotherapy-clinic&quot;&gt;physio&lt;/a&gt; there. She didn&apos;t know what was wrong as my knee was moving well and there was no swelling, but she threw everything she could at trying to fix it. Massage, cupping, acupuncture hooked up to electricity... Nothing helped. Back home I enlisted the help of a local physio, Kenny, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://spaceclinics.co.uk/kenny-watt/&quot;&gt;Space Clinics&lt;/a&gt;. Working with the same information - everything was moving well and there was no inflammation - he prescribed lots of glute and leg strengthening exercises. This worked, to a point. I was able to build my mileage back up and run an autumn ultra. However there were a few setbacks during the process - too many miles made my knee sore again, and meant I needed to back off for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my last race of the season I took a few weeks off, and at Kenny&apos;s suggestion, booked an MRI scan. It took a long time for various frustrating reasons and I didn&apos;t get the results until the beginning of 2020. They confirmed what I&apos;d been dreading - a tear in my medial meniscus. After several more weeks waiting to see a surgeon, things suddenly moved very quickly and I was booked in for an arthroscopy to remove the torn meniscal cartilage the following week. I was terrified and told only a few people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The operation was a week ago and went well. I still can&apos;t get my head around the fact that I was put to sleep, and someone cut my knee open, but I have the stitches to prove it! My knee mobility has been steadily improving throughout the last week. I&apos;m under strict instructions from Kenny to not walk around much. I&apos;m listening. Plus I&apos;ve felt totally wiped out after the operation and have been unable to focus on anything (this post has taken several days to finish!), so have been mainly sleeping. My knee is bruised but not too swollen. It still hurts but it&apos;s bearable and I&apos;ve cut down on the painkillers as they were making me feel too fuzzy. Sometimes I worry that it&apos;s the old pain, the same pain as before. What if the operation hasn&apos;t fixed it? Will tells me I worry too much. He may be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this week I&apos;m trying not to think too much about the rest of the year. I had big plans for 2020, and maybe some of those will need to be adjusted. That&apos;s ok. For now I&apos;m in the mountains, spending the week resting and elevating my leg while my friends ski. I&apos;m trying not to be too gutted at missing out on that and instead I&apos;m accepting where I am right now. It&apos;s not where I want to be, but it&apos;s temporary. Fitness comes and goes. I&apos;ll need to work hard soon, but I will come back stronger. The stitches come out next week and then I&apos;ll be able to start training in the pool. Hopefully I&apos;ll have enough mobility to use a turbo. Until then I&apos;ll enjoy the mountain views from my window and focus on recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took 4 trains to get us to Farnham, where the North Downs Way starts. It was dry, not too cold, and we were traveling light, excited to be free and alone after a family Christmas. Excited for another new adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set off. Road, trail, road, trail. We didn&apos;t get lost till the second mile. We checked the map and went back to where we&apos;d missed the sign. After 5 miles the trail was flooded. Water obscured the path as far as we could see. We checked the map again and found a way around on a road. We figured we&apos;d done about a mile extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route was muddy and lots of fun. Through forests on a winding trail, across rolling hills, emerging suddenly in small villages with huge houses. Sticky mud that sucked each step into it with a delightful squelch. It was my favourite sort of trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&apos;t stop to drink until two and a half hours. We&apos;d been having too much fun, but we shouldn&apos;t have waited this long. We bypassed Guildford and quickly got hungry and wished we&apos;d stopped. We were covered in mud. Finally we reached an amazing cafe at Newlands Corner called &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepluckypheasant.com/&quot;&gt;The Plucky Pheasant&lt;/a&gt;. We were the muckiest in there but there was already mud on the floor so we didn&apos;t feel out of place. We ate paninis and treated ourselves to chips, craving the warmth and saltiness. Revived by food and coke we set out again in high spirits, hoping to reach Dorking before dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;d eaten too much. For the next few miles I felt dizzy and ill and Will felt sick. We slowed considerably. I told stories of running cross country races at Denbies Wine Estate and we fantasised about arriving there. It seemed a long time coming. Finally we arrived, just ahead of the rapidly approaching darkness, and saw the shapes and lights of Dorking spread below us. Reaching the main road we turned off the trail and towards town and a hot shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a lovely evening of pizza and Star Wars, although it wasn&apos;t a real cinema and the seats had no leg room. After nearly three hours of cramped legs my knee stiffened and walking was painful. We consulted the map and decided to finish early the next day, at Merstham. It was an easy place to get a train from, and meant a much shorter run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mile on the road back to the trail in the morning was slow and painful. The same stabbing pain I&apos;d felt in my calf the previous week had returned and it made lifting my leg very difficult. Once I got into a rhythm on the flat or downhill it was manageable, but uphill was not good. I hoped it would ease off as my muscles warmed up. Unfortunately from Dorking the North Downs Way goes up Box Hill. It wasn&apos;t quite the start I was hoping for! More fortunately, it&apos;s mostly big steps, so there was little running anyway. I had a tantrum partway up, telling Will my knee was sore and I couldn&apos;t do it and it was too hard and there was no way I could run this in a single day. He suggested firmly that I pull myself together. By the time we reached the top of the hill I&apos;d snapped out of it. We chased a group of mountain bikers along some muddy trails and luckily lost them before the long gradual descent. It was great fun and we loved having the trail to ourselves here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Reigate there were people everywhere and we slowed to appreciate the final views and the last few miles. We stopped running as we entered Merstham and had time for coffee and to change into warm clothes before the train arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first day on the island was my birthday. After a lazy breakfast we ran in the Parque National de los Volcanoes around the Caldera Blanca. It was hot, dry and dusty, on a largely flat trail with some detours up volcanic craters. We had one sketchy descent where our path disappeared and we had to scramble down the rock face. We stopped to enjoy a picnic lunch on a rock. The last few miles were on road and I felt myself speeding up involuntarily as it somehow felt like the end of a triathlon! I realised why so many road bikers come to Lanzarote. The roads are super smooth, up and down long rolling hills without too much traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A storm came in overnight and the next day was very windy and rather wet. We drove south to Femés. Rather misleadingly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cicerone.co.uk/walking-on-lanzarote-and-fuerteventura-second&quot;&gt;guidebook&lt;/a&gt; said the first part of the trail was quite exposed. We took a wrong turn and ended up on a very exposed rock face in rising wind, surprised that the guidebook would suggest a path like this even with a warning. Luckily we looked more closely at the route description and realised we were going the wrong way around a hill. We reversed to safety. The other side was far more sheltered! We combined two walks from the guidebook for an interesting run around some rocky craters. The final climb was a battle up a zig zag track into the wind, feeling like we could be back in Scotland (but a lot warmer)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third day we took a ferry to the small island of La Graciosa and ran around the easter half of it. It was a huge contrast to the previous day and was we ran in glorious sunshine on pale sandy beach all the way. We hiked up Montaña Bermeja for beautiful views across Playa de los Conchas and the ocean. I resisted the temptation to try and run around the whole island. Instead we enjoyed a lazy lunch on the beach in the sunshine before taking the ferry back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GR131 south to north&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GR131 is a long distance trail crossing all of the Canary Islands. On Lanzarote it stretches 45 miles (72km) across the island. The &quot;official&quot; way to run it is north to south and the km markers are numbered for that. This is probably sensible as it means you will be going with the prevailing wind, rather than against it. However we didn&apos;t realise this and the guidebook describes the route the opposite way, so we ran from south to north over 3 days. This time I&apos;d planned the days carefully with fewer miles on the first and last days to allow us to get to and from the trail. We parked our car in the capital city, Arrecife, and took a bus to the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Playa Blanca to Conil (18 miles)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started with our toes in the sea and narrowly avoided being soaked by a big wave. We ran out of the busy town of Playa Blanca amidst bemused looks from tourists who were lazing about in the sun. The suburbs were full of run-down buildings and wasteland, which turned into lava fields . The path cut through black sand and nothingness until the next village of Las Breñas rose out of the desert. It was the hottest day so far and Will did not enjoy the heat, the dull trail, and running with a heavy bag. I ran ahead and doubled back to him a few times, feeling surprisingly sprightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped in Yaiza for coffee and a sandwich and both got a second wind. We detoured off the path to climb a volcano as we were bored of the flat sandy path through the desert! This was much more fun, with lots of loose sand and rock at the top which made the descent interesting.

&lt;p&gt;My left knee and the muscles around it stiffened a lot overnight, which meant the first part of the run was a painful shuffle. We got very lost at Montaña Blanca due to a lack of signs and confusing directions in the guidebook. We were halfway up Montaña Blanca itself when we realised we should be much lower and heading to the village of the same name. I decided to climb to the top anyway. From the village the route took a convoluted wiggle around several volcanoes to eventually reach San Bartolomé, which we could see ahead for ages. The main road we&apos;d been on not too long before went directly to it and we grew irritated with the guidebook and whoever made the GR route! We continued on to the old capital of Teguise, growing increasingly hot and tired. Finally we arrived and found a shady cafe for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We climbed from Teguise to the highest point of the island (Peñas del Chache at 672m). We didn&apos;t go quite that high as it&apos;s out of bounds, but reached over 600m, which isn&apos;t very high at all! There were lots of people hiking around the top and cars parked in surprising places off the road, but the GR signs kept us straight here. Finally we could see the village of Haría below us. The descent to it was the best running we had all week - the trail dropping sharply through rocks and cutting across switchbacks in the road, skipping over boulders and bushes. I danced down, loving it. We finished with ice cream, coke and chocolate milk in the quirky mountain town of Haría.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Haría to Órzola (7.5 miles)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My delight at the final descent the previous day had led me to be quite reckless as I ran down and forget about protecting my left knee. I spent the evening massaging the calf which had tightened and was made it painful to straighten my leg. I was worried I wouldn&apos;t be able to run at all but managed a slow shuffle to start. Every time I lifted my leg there was a sharp, stabbing pain at the top of my calf where it went into the knee joint. Luckily the route was mostly downhill to the sea at Órzola. After the muscle warmed up the pain eased and I could get into a rhythm, using gravity and momentum to push me forwards. I channelled all my thoughts into running with good form and trying to keep my left foot and arm doing the right thing. Finally we reached the final km marker of the GR131 and not long after, the port of Órzola and the end of our journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely holiday, but I have to confess that Lanzarote is my least favourite Canary Island so far. Apart from scattered volcanoes it was very flat, and the trails were quite uninteresting and same-y. Whereas other islands have forests and lots of trees, Lanzarote was mostly desert, and I missed the variety. However the weather was lovely and December was a great time to visit as it wasn&apos;t too busy or hot. If I went back I&apos;d definitely hire a road bike!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A plan that didn't come together]]></title><description><![CDATA[The end of my 2019 running season didn't quite go to plan. After a month of little running after Lavaredo I built back up slowly with the help of some great physio sessions with Kenny at Space Clinics. Matt carefully wrote me a training plan which we tweaked weekly depending on how my knee was recovering. At the beginning we didn't know if I'd be able to complete the training. But my knee slowly improved and I arrived in France ready to run the Grand Trail des Templiers feeling fit and confident. I'd recce'd the route in August and was excited to run on the trails there.]]></description><link>https://powderach.com/posts/a-plan-that-didnt-come-together</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://powderach.com/posts/a-plan-that-didnt-come-together</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

&lt;p&gt;The end of my 2019 running season didn&apos;t quite go to plan. After a month of little running after Lavaredo I built back up slowly with the help of some great physio sessions with Kenny at &lt;a href=&quot;https://spaceclinics.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Space Clinics&lt;/a&gt;. Matt carefully wrote me a training plan which we tweaked weekly depending on how my knee was recovering. At the beginning we didn&apos;t know if I&apos;d be able to complete the training. But my knee slowly improved and I arrived in France ready to run the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.festivaldestempliers.com/courses/templiers/&quot;&gt;Grand Trail des Templiers&lt;/a&gt; feeling fit and confident. I&apos;d recce&apos;d the route in August and was excited to run on the trails there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas it wasn&apos;t to be this year. I woke up at 1am on race morning to an email titled &quot;Annulation Grand Trail des Templiers&quot;. The race was cancelled! I ran it through Google Translate a few times to be sure. The Facebook post announcing the same had been shared over 1,000 times and had as many comments (mainly in angry French as far as I could tell). After a confused few hours convincing myself that this was real, I went back to sleep. The weather later in the day was the most extreme I&apos;ve ever been in, with huge storms and lightning directly overhead. Cancellation was absolutely the right decision by the organisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still disappointed and full of energy though! I had a stressful week in France and all sorts of travel troubles trying to get home. Meanwhile Matt was busy in the background finding me a race to run for the big end of season finale...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.highterrainevents.co.uk/ennerdale-ultra-trail&quot;&gt;Ennerdale Ultra Trail&lt;/a&gt; is a 50km race in the western Lake District, organised by the great team at High Terrain Events (who also organise the excellent Glentress races). It&apos;s two laps around Ennerdale Water and from the course description sounded very fast and runnable.  Matt looked at race times from previous years and suggested I aim to run 4 hours 30. It seemed reasonable when I broke that down, and 50km was much shorter than what I&apos;d been training for, so I should have the endurance... but did I have the speed?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s very hard not to go out too hard. The terrain at the start was flat and runnable. I&apos;d been bouncing off the walls all week in some sort of reverse-taper madness. My legs felt good and fast felt easy. I tried to reign myself in. After the first few miles I ran alone. It was cold and drizzly but the views across the lake were stunning. The loop climbed gradually to Black Sail where there was a water station. I ran straight through and into the boggy section. This was quite slow but there were some long downhills to balance it out. Then the path dropped to next to the lake and became a lot more interesting: hopping over rocks and a roped scramble over Anglers Crag. My plan had been to run the first lap in 2 hours 10, but this section slowed me substantially and I finished the loop in 2:14 and in 8th place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I overtook one guy in the halfway aid station as I didn&apos;t stop, and another guy who was walking just after it. He managed to hang on to me for a mile or so, but dropped back on the climb. I kept running but was annoyed to be moving much slower than on the first lap. I was feeling low from about mile 19 until just after Black Sail. I got a huge boost here from the encouragement from Ian the Race Director who had mountain biked around. By the time I got to the downhill section I was feeling strong and ran this much faster on the second lap, passing another guy. I caught the next guy as we reached the technical section and managed to lose him on this. It was tiring to constantly hop over rocks but I was feeling good again, and was pushing so hard I almost cramped up when I had to slow for the scramble! I knew I wasn&apos;t going to finish under my target but I kept pushing on to the finish and came in at 4:33.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleased to finish 1st female and 4th overall. My second lap was 5 minutes slower than the first, which isn&apos;t perfect, but much better than most others in the race! It was a good finish to the season: I&apos;ve learned lots from running some big international races but it&apos;s always nice to race a bit closer to home! I&apos;m looking forward to a rest from racing now and starting on some strength training to build up to a big 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain biking was not my first choice. However I picked up a knee niggle after Lavaredo and haven&apos;t run much since, so it seemed the safest option. In a previous life I did a fair bit of mountain biking and I&apos;m not bad at it. I spent a summer leading kids on mountain bike trails in the Redwoods of California, but that was a long time ago (and on very cruisey trails). I&apos;d borrowed a mountain bike to use for the summer to give my legs a rest after the Dolomites, but I wasn&apos;t very confident with it. On my first outing to the Pentlands the back tyre exploded which wasn&apos;t a great sign. I also wasn&apos;t confident about how my knee would hold up to 4 days of heavy activity. The physio had encouraged keeping active but there&apos;s a chance she didn&apos;t fully appreciate what my weekend plans entailed. Still, I was willing to give the adventure my best shot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 1 - Garve to Oykel Bridge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set off from Garve in glorious sunshine. After an initial deviation from the route which ended in carrying the bike through bushes and over a fence, we quickly learnt that we should trust the GPS. The route for the first day was all on Landrover tracks. It was very easy to roll along on a mountain bike but not such a fun run for Elaine as the surface was hard and lacking in variety. I stopped frequently for her to catch up. This doubtless encouraged Elaine to run faster than she should have on day 1 of a multi day long run! But the weather was fabulous and the views stunning so we were not in a rush. We saw some herds of deer and stopped to listen to  them calling to each other. It felt like we were miles from civilisation and we saw no one. The navigation was easy and we arrived at the finish line in good time. To make it easier for Janet we continued on to Oykel Bridge and finished at a pub there. For this last section Elaine rode the bike and I ran (as it wasn&apos;t strictly on the route). It was easy undulating trail and my knee felt fine. I ran fast to avoid the bike getting too far ahead and understood why Elaine felt like she had been running slowly all day! We waited a while for Janet who arrived flustered and unimpressed with the google directions which had led her down a private road with a locked gate, meaning a long drive round to meet us! We stayed even further north in Lairg and were joined later by Tim and Jackie and shared a bottle of wine. It was an excellent first day of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 2 - Oykel Bridge to Inverbroom Lodge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 started on a decent Landrover track with some steep sections. My uphill mountain bike strategy was &quot;point and pedal&quot; and I was pleased to find that my legs were still strong from my month in the mountains, and in the lowest gear I could ride up slopes far steeper than I expected. We had an ambitious plan to take a fifteen km detour up a Munro (I planned to leave the bike at the bottom) but we arrived at the turnoff for it in thick mist and decided it was a silly idea! This turned out to be a very good call as the day got rapidly more difficult and energy sapping. We rolled down to a small lochearn with a lonely boat hugging its shore, then headed off path and into bog. I carried the bike down a steep tussocky slope to a river, across it and back up the other side. We laughed about it, not realising that this was to become the new pattern for the afternoon. But first some technical single track with a steep drop off on the left. It looked great fun to run but I was a little nervous on the bike. Luckily my good right leg was my uphill leg so I could use it to push off sections and I managed to stay on the bike (and on the trail)!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day got wetter as we headed even further off path to follow the Cape Wrath trail. It seemed to be mainly unmarked but the GPS told us we were on track. We came across a hiker going in the opposite direction. He told us that we had a lot more off-path and boggy sections to come. He was right. The next three hours were a long slog through bog, across tussocky ground and up steep grassy banks. I pushed the bike when I could and carried it on my shoulder when I couldn&apos;t. A few times we climbed up things that were so steep the weight of the bike toppled me over. It was intermittently raining but quite warm. Elaine told me afterwards that the views were good, but I struggled to focus on anything other than keeping the bike on my shoulder and keeping moving. My sore knee did not enjoy the off camber weighted hike. Yet somehow we stayed in good spirits and kept smiling. This was all part of the adventure, and that&apos;s what we&apos;d signed up for! Finally we reached Inverlael Forest and gravel tracks. I jumped back on the bike and freewheeled down, savouring the easy descents. We made up some extra distance in the forest here and finished feeling strong and happy as the sun came back out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting out of bed on the morning of day 3 was very difficult. My arms and back were very stiff from all the bike carrying! I wasn&apos;t sure how much more of that I&apos;d be able to do. However we&apos;d looked at the next part of route and thought that after the first section it should all be rideable. I made a last minute decision to run the first section with Elaine rather than wait around for her with the bike. We spent the first ten minutes trying to reunite a lamb with its mother. It had ended up in a neighbouring field and we came across them bleating at each other in distress and eventually managed to coax the lamb through a gate to rejoin the other sheep. Running together was much more fun and much more social than biking as our pace was more evenly matched. However I had to check my ego on the descent and let Elaine fly ahead. I picked my way down more cautiously in order to protect my left knee. After ten km we reached a road crossing where Janet had left the bike. I picked that up and we started on a big climb up a wide track. It got very steep with lots of loose gravel so I ended up pushing the bike for most of it. As the track got steeper and rockier still we were amazed to see three Landrovers pass us! We hadn&apos;t seen anyone else all day and it seemed very wrong to see these machines cutting through the landscape here!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the big climb we had a fun gravelly descent and found the Landrovers at the end of the road. There were people standing around them looking like they were preparing to go deer stalking. We left them behind and turned onto onto a wet and muddy singletrack. It was bikeable but slow and Elaine had to keep looping back for me. We followed along a river until our route suddenly crossed it. It was both deeper and wider than we expected and the water came up over our knees. I waded across with the bike on my shoulder and was glad that the water wasn&apos;t flowing very fast! Our final climb of the day was steep, rocky and technical so I had to carry the bike up most of it. It was very hard work. The descent was similarly steep, rocky and technical but luckily not too narrow. My downhill mantra became &quot;It&apos;s gonna be ok&quot; and I repeated this to myself as I rolled down big boulders and somehow stayed on the bike, just about balancing on the right side of control. It was definitely the most technical trail I&apos;ve ever ridden and I reached the bottom in disbelief that I&apos;d made it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow I stayed on the bike down this trail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we crossed the causeway between Dubh Loch and Fionn Loch I realised I had a puncture in the back tyre (not that surprising after the big descent!) We changed the inner tube and put the wheel back on but now something was very wrong with the bike. It would no longer freewheel. The pedals turned with the wheel but not in a useful way that would move the bike if I tried to ride it. We&apos;d been out for around seven hours by this time and wondered if we&apos;d somehow put the wheel on wrong because we were tired, but tried it a few times and it was still broken. I started to push and Elaine valiantly settled in to walk with me. After a few miles we realised this was a very slow way to travel and Janet was going to be worried about us. Also we were going to miss our dinner booking, which was a real concern as we were running out of food and getting hungry! Elaine ran on ahead to try and get phone signal to organise things. I kept pushing the bike and &quot;riding&quot; downhill - sitting on the saddle with my legs out to keep out of the way of the pedals, with the back brake on enough to stop the chain coming off. It wasn&apos;t the most comfortable but it meant I covered the downhill a lot quicker than on foot! I made it through the forest and was on the Landrover track heading towards Poolewe when Elaine and Janet rescued me in the car. Luckily we&apos;d been able to reschedule dinner and after warm shower and a pizza, all was well again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 4 - near Poolewe - near Torridon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long chat with Adam the bike expert / owner I understood what the problem was with the back wheel and how to fix it. It took a lot of patience but I eventually managed to do so and we began the final morning without too much delay. It was wet from the start and the forecast was for it to get wetter. It wasn&apos;t the ideal end to our adventure but perhaps the most fitting for the north of Scotland (in July)! We set off amidst a cloud of midges onto some challenging technical paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was so much water on the trail that it felt like riding through a river. I got a second back puncture  but this time changed the tube and got the wheel back on without any drama (except being eaten alive by midges). This first trail section took us longer than we&apos;d anticipated but we finally reached the A832. Elaine crossed the road and set off onto another trail. Her route involved a big off-path section between trails that would be silly to attempt on a bike. I set off to go the long way round on the road to intercept her at the next road crossing on the A896. My &quot;easy&quot; ride here was 18 miles up and down hills in lashing rain and wind. I enjoyed being able to ride fast on the smooth surface but cars sped past me too close and too fast and I worried for my safety. I stopped at the gas station in Kinlochewe for a much-needed espresso before the final 6 miles into a headwind on the road to Torridon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the bike partway down the road and set off to meet Elaine. I started out in good spirits, looking forward to company and sharing tales of our separate adventures. As I neared the point where she would be joining the path and there was still no sign of her I started to get worried. Visibility was about twenty metres and I definitely didn&apos;t want to step off the path and be swallowed up by the mist. I was soaked through and starting to get cold so I put on all the clothes I had in my pack, including full waterproofs. I blew my whistle and shouted for Elaine. After some minutes of this I started back towards the road. I had to keep moving to keep myself warm. If I got all the way back to the road without Elaine catching me I could hail down a car and give them Janet&apos;s number so she could come to meet us, then I could head back out to search for Elaine once I was warm. I went back slowly and cautiously, often pausing to look back and shout and whistle. I tried not to worry too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Finally, less than a mile from the road I heard Elaine shouting my name. We were so relieved to see each other again! Elaine had had a far worse time than I had done, with little visibility, water logged ground and lots of deep river crossings. I was so impressed she&apos;d been able to find the path and her way back! We ran down to the road together and luckily Elaine had enough phone signal to reach Janet who came to our rescue in the car. We were due to finish in Achnashellach but were so cold and wet that we made the sensible decision to call it a day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily there was a hot shower, hot food and entertaining stories waiting for us in Strathcarron, and hosts who didn&apos;t mind that we arrived a few hours later than we planned! It didn&apos;t take long to feel human again. However it took longer to forget the feeling of being scared and alone on the hill in bad weather, not knowing where your friend is. It was a good lesson for us both. Luckily it all ended well and was a great adventure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time I&apos;ll definitely run rather than bike...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start line was rammed and I let myself get carried along, moving with the taller people in the dark, careful not to get a pole in the face. We ran through the crowds and up out of town. I kept running on the uphill roads, knowing we’d head onto track after a mile and a half. Poles were produced and waved around. I kept my head down and started hiking. Soon I came across Ryan Hogben who was moving fast uphill as he’d got boxed in at the start. We fell into what felt like an easy pace and ran along chatting, overtaking lots of people. In hindsight this was probably too fast. We were running uphill when we should have been walking. It was lovely to have company in the dark though and these miles flew by and we were at the first high point at Forcella Pospocora in no time. The descent from here was fairly technical but we cruised down it, letting faster people pass when they got too close behind. We reached the first aid station together in just under 2 hours. Ryan said that was about what he was aiming for. I worried it was a little fast, but didn’t really know so stayed relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my poles out for the next climb and Ryan pulled ahead. In the dark the climbing didn’t feel too tough. When I’d recced this part a few weeks before there had been a lot of snow but now it was all clear. As I ran down to Tre Croci I realised I hadn’t eaten anything and had half a rice crispy square. By this point it was about 2am and my body was not convinced eating was a good idea. It was mainly downhill from here to the next aid station at Federreveccia and I tried to relax. This path had been almost impassable on my recce due to fallen trees but they had all been cleared away now and the trail underneath was soft and spongy and easy running. At the second aid station I got worried that I had lost my cup. This kept haunting me throughout the race (much later I took a plastic one from an aid station, and later still found my original cup stuffed in my pack underneath a soft flask). Now I worried. The next climb felt ok and I remembered hiking up it previously with Will and trying to avoid a storm. I wasn’t feeling great on the run down to Lake Misurina and was nervous about tripping over a tree root in the darkness, but I made it down safely. I started to struggle on the climb after the lake, but it was starting to get light and turning off my headtorch made me feel better. The snow was gone here too and the climb was very different to the one we’d done some weeks before - we’d tried to follow footprints through the snow and ended up on the other side of the road!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of females overtook me at the top of the climb, including Anna-Marie Watson, another British female. She had been tipped to do well in the race and I had a sinking feeling that I should probably not have gone out ahead of someone with so much more experience! Still, I felt stronger after the aid station, where I had a few mouthfuls of noodle soup. I had a bit of a headache but the saltiness of the soup made that subside. I also switched Tailwind for Active Root in one of my soft flasks and this went down a lot better. Running alongside Tre Cime as the sun came up was incredible. There was low cloud hanging in the valley to the right and the views were stunning. Lots of people stopped to take photos, but I assumed there were photographers around who would do a much better job than I would with my average camera phone, and continued. The traverse after the saddle was on a lovely runnable trail, totally different from when we’d recced it in deep snow. The snow-free descent was also a lot of fun and quite technical in places. I passed Anna-Marie here, but figured she would soon catch me back, and I was right - she passed me running easily on the gradual uphill cycle track in to the aid station at Cimabanche. I was running with Ryan again and we were both struggling, running bits and walking bits. It concerned me that I felt like this already, but I was looking forward to the aid station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cimabanche was the drop bag point, just after halfway. I was pleased to get there, but didn’t know what to do with either my drop bag or myself. I didn’t want anything in the bag. I got another bowl of noodle soup and had a few more mouthfuls, and some coke. I wasn’t feeling great and knew I hadn’t eaten much, and it was soon going to get hot, which wouldn’t help. Sophie Grant arrived as I was about to leave the aid station, looking fresh, and I knew I’d see her again soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next climb was one I hadn’t recced. It looked small on the course profile but still took about 45 minutes to reach the top. My plan of only using poles for some of the steep climbs had gone out the window and I was relying on them heavily to help me on all the ascents. I struggled to run down the other side. My legs and feet were hurting and I was starting to have serious doubts about the race. I made it to the next aid station at Malga Ra Stua. People say the race starts from here. That wasn’t a good sign as I was already feeling awful. There was still about 50km to go and I was barely running. I stopped at a fountain to douse myself in water. It was already hot and I had learned a good lesson about keeping cool at Transvulcania. Sophie caught me here and also stopped to cool off in the fountain. She set off running strongly up the hill in front of me while I settled in to walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big traverse round to Val Travenanzes (Death Valley) was long and difficult in the heat. Then there was no shade in Death Valley and it went on forever. Luckily the path through was well marked, which meant less river crossings than when I’d recced it, and the river was lower too. The river crossings were lovely and I took my time over them, savouring the cold water, and at one point sat down in the river (probably a bad call as I had bad chafing  after that!). The final climb out of the valley went on for ages and lots of people passed me. I felt very demoralised. I was calculating in my head how long it would take me to reach the finish, but I was only moving at about 3km an hour and that was far too long to think about properly, so I went back to thinking about the next aid station. If I could make it to Col Gallina then I could do it. It wasn’t going to be pretty and it was going to take a very long time, but I could do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could barely run down from the top of the climb, or on the next descent to Col Gallina, but I made it there. Greg from La Sportiva was by the entrance to the aid station cheering, but I told him I was broken (actually I said something much less polite than that). He was impossibly cheery and told me I was doing great, which I knew was a lie. One of the women who’d passed me on the descent was still in the aid station and she came over to check I was ok and told me I needed to eat something. I tried a little more soup. I didn’t want to stay for long or I would never leave this nice shady place, so I headed out the tent and forced myself to run the initial downhill. I was boosted by support from Matt Wilson before the trail started to climb up to Averau. This climb wasn’t too bad, but I was moving super slowly and not even running on the flatter bits. Averau was an interim aid station and they had iced tea and a very welcome cold shower. There was much less water on this side of the mountain. I had mistakenly thought it was downhill from here to Passo Giau, but there was a big traverse and another climb before the descent into the aid station. It was hot and neverending. Everyone came past me and I stood aside and waved them by, trying to stay cheerful. I had no fight left. I ate some fruit at Passo Giau and mixed up some more Active Root. There were two more climbs from here to the next aid station, then it was all downhill into Cortina. I could do it. I was convinced I saw Eóin running out of this aid station, which was a little surprising as he wasn’t in the race, but I thought maybe he was there to take photos. I tried calling his name and shouting after him but couldn’t catch him. He also swears it wasn’t him. I tried to chat with a Canadian guy who was moving about the same pace as me but he didn’t seem interested so I resigned myself back to my own thoughts. They were not particularly pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interim checkpoint here was between the two climbs. Everyone else was running on the flatter section but I just picked my way along slowly with my poles. One foot in front of the other. I was going to make it. I wobbled a bit and the marshal let me finish his bottle of coke. Some elderly walkers overtook me on the way up the final climb and stopped to check I was ok. I was so embarrassed. Every time I caught someone’s eye they had to look away. I’m rubbish at hiding my feelings and my pain and humiliation was written all over my face. I don’t know why or how I was still moving, but I wasn’t going to give up. I wanted to finish despite how hard it was. I was inspired by Aisling who’d suffered through her race the previous day but had kept going and finished and I thought that was incredible. I needed to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggled to breathe in the heat. A full breath made me cough so with each breath I only half filled my lungs. This meant I was constantly fighting the urge to panic as I wasn’t breathing calmly. I had never realised before how much I rely on deep breathing to keep myself calm and in control. The last climb was only short but very steep. I felt lightheaded by the top and had to pause before starting down the other side.  Finally I arrived at the last checkpoint. It was all downhill from here. I had no elation or relief as I knew this would still take me well over an hour at my current pace, but there was a photographer on the way out of this checkpoint and I held my head high. I was going to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last descent was not pretty and it went on for much longer than I thought it would. Some bits were steep and technical and I was far too cautious. My feet hurt and running hurt and I wanted it all to be over. But I kept moving and not too many people passed me. I finally reached a road and the village above Cortina. Some locals had set up their own aid station and were handing out watermelon, which tasted incredible. I kept walking the ups and using gravity to help ‘run’ the descents. A British man appeared from a driveway and told me he had been tracking me all day and was so pleased I was here. I have no idea who he was, or if he was really there. I hiked up to the main street and the final run in to the finish. I paused to gather myself. I put on my sunglasses as I didn’t trust myself not to break down completely (and I wanted to maintain some pride), and started to run. Given that I had barely run at all in the previous 10 hours, I was surprised at how easy it seemed. I high fived some people and kept running. I heard my name called by Aisling, Eóin and Lynne and I smiled. I finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My emotions are still pretty raw and it&apos;s still hard to objectively look at my race. I can already see there are some things that went well. I finished, when I really didn’t know if I could. I ran the furthest I’ve ever run, and for the first time all through the night. I fought on, even when I thought I had no fight left. But there are so many more things that didn’t go so well and I have a lot to learn. During the whole 18 hours 38 minutes it took me, I ate 2 rice crispy squares, 2 Clif Shot Bloks and a couple of mouthfuls of soup and fruit at the later aid stations. It&apos;s hardly surprising I had no energy later on in the race!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;18 hours of wet feet is not pretty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people didn’t finish. The heat was intense and it meant there was a high drop out rate. I not only finished, I was 15th lady and 131st overall. So many people overtook me in the latter half of the race that I felt like it was much worse. I have so much respect for everyone who ran, whether they finished or not. Running usually makes me a better person, but I’m not sure it did in this race, and that cuts pretty deep. I have some soul searching to do in the next few weeks. I&apos;m not proud of how I ran the race but I did enjoy the experience of it. Cheering Aisling and Eóin in their races was fun and it was great to hang out with the La Sportiva crew (and massive congratulations to Sophie who was 9th, and John Kelly who was 32nd overall, despite having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://randomforestrunner.com/2019/06/2019-lavaredo-120k/&quot;&gt;tough race&lt;/a&gt;). And hanging out with new Scottish friends Lachlan, Lynne and Richard before the start was great and I learnt a lot from their collective Euro racing experience! The race itself was beautiful and well organised and I&apos;d recommend it to anyone. The Dolomites are fast becoming my favourite mountains, they are truly stunning. Overall I had an amazing month living and training in the mountains and this is what I will take away from my time in the Dolomites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dolomiti Extreme Trail]]></title><description><![CDATA[Will and I signed up for the 23km race at the Dolomiti Extreme Trail to finish off a week of training (er, I mean a holiday) in the Dolomites.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled ahead of Will as we ran through the next village. I wanted to finish ahead of him but I knew it would be difficult. 23km and 1300m ascent is the sort of race where he thrives, but I was feeling super fit and wanted to push on the hills to see how I could do. After the first few small bumps we reached the big climb up to Col de le Ole at 1450m. I got my poles out at the bottom here - they weren&apos;t really necessary but I wanted the practice! It was a wide gravel track with switchbacks, so I alternated between hiking the steep sections with the poles and running the flatter bits with the occasional stab at the floor with the poles and pretending I was a train (translation: looking like a massive idiot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an unexpected aid station two thirds of the way up the climb (officially there was only meant to be one, but it seemed every village wanted to join in). After this the climb got very steep and rocky. I was spurred on by a 64 year old German man who told me I was a &quot;very good runner&quot; as he overtook me (although I didn&apos;t fully trust this compliment as he&apos;d only seen me hiking up the hill). Whenever I looked back on a switchback I could see Will not too far behind me, alongside a lady in a yellow tshirt. I didn&apos;t want either of them to catch me!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we reached the top and ran along a narrow ridge before dropping down into a forest. The descent was great: not too steep or technical which meant you could run really fast. I caught lots of people here, including my German friend. When we finally reached the bottom and the (official) aid station I was told I was the &apos;prima femmina&apos; female. My Italian isn&apos;t great but I had an inkling this meant first. I didn&apos;t want to get too excited and just smiled and nodded. Will was still hot on my heels but he seemed to have shaken yellow tshirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here it was up and down weaving through small villages on a mix of tarmac and trail between them. The villages were full of cheering locals who&apos;d set up food and water stations, and in one place, a cold shower! The next time I looked behind there was no one in sight and I realised I had pulled ahead of Will. People were still shouting &quot;prima femmina&quot; at me so I kept pushing. There was a fast downhill finish and I had a good sprint in to the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will finished 3 minutes later and we were 19th and 21st respectively. For being the prima femmina I won 2l prosecco, 900g cheese, 500g pasta (to add to the 2kg we&apos;d got at registration), beer, a tshirt, a plant, a backpack, and at the award ceremony they played the national anthem for me on stage. It felt very over the top but I tried my best to look patriotic (and not catch Will&apos;s eye).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole race was on a clear marked trail and well groomed mountain paths (although I did almost take a wrong turn winding through one of the villages). It had the friendly vibe of a low key hill race, but from the award ceremony and crowds felt much bigger. I&apos;d definitely recommend it if you&apos;re looking for a European race. 50 and 103km options also available.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Transvulcania 2019]]></title><link>https://powderach.com/posts/transvulcania-2019</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://powderach.com/posts/transvulcania-2019</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race morning started with a 3:30 am bus to Fuencaliente. I was too nervous to sleep on the bus, but this was reminiscent of last year&apos;s Fling and it hadn&apos;t mattered then. I ate overnight oats walking down to the lighthouse when we were dropped off. It was cold in the wind so I put on a super light waterproof jacket that I planned to carry with me and made sure I was in a good position for when the start pen opened. I wished I was in the elite pen, but no matter, when the main pen opened I got into a good position not too far back and stood like a sardine for an hour, refusing to give up my spot. The atmosphere was electric. We counted down from ten in Spanish to AC/DC and then set off to cries of &quot;Venga, venga!&quot; The first mile or so was uphill on road, before we turned onto the sand. I&apos;d heeded Bob&apos;s advice about the clouds of dust and sand during the early stage and had a buff to breathe through, but it made little difference and quickly I felt my lungs fill with dust and wanted to cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed Gemma as we got to the first off-road section and we exchanged a &quot;see you later&quot;. I tried to control my breathing and the adrenalin surging through me. I was running. I felt good. As we hit the wide gravel track I chanced a glance behind me. My heart filled with excitement at the sight of the trail of headtorches lighting the darkness all the way back to the sea. This was awesome, and I was part of it! The trail narrowed again to single file before Los Canarios but everyone around me was climbing happily and there was no rushing or pushing. One guy stumbled on a rock and we all helped him up. I realised probably everyone else was as nervous as I was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href=&quot;https://iancorless.org/2018/05/24/episode-156-kelly-wolfe-brittany-peterson-and-alex-kurt/&quot;&gt;podcast after last year&apos;s race&lt;/a&gt; Ian Corless said that coming through Los Canarios is like being in the Tour de France. I&apos;m not sure it lived up to this hype for me, but the crowds were immense and hyper and I can imagine if you were one of the first runners through it would have been wild. There were people lining the streets, many of them still in dressing gowns, dancing to the loud music pumping from the aid station, and volunteers everywhere. I&apos;d barely touched my water so I didn&apos;t stop. From Los Canarios we climbed for the next ten or so miles before a short descent to El Pilar. I got my poles out and settled into a rhythm climbing on the sand, trying not to get too close to anyone to avoid a faceful of dust. The dust was everywhere and made breathing harder. We climbed above the cloud and were rewarded with incredible views of other islands poking through and the sun coming up between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached El Pilar sooner than I&apos;d expected and feeling great. I topped up my water and continued on, passing lots of people in the aid station. The marathoners were all lining the path and cheering us on as they waited to start their race. The support here was incredible and we were made to feel like superstars. The trail is super runnable from El Pilar and I felt myself flow into a nice rhythm. A woman caught up to me and I slipped in behind her. It was starting to heat up and there wasn&apos;t much shade on the wide track. The next aid station also came sooner than expected. I refilled both bottles but turned down the offer of cold water on my head, which turned out to be a mistake. From here we started to climb again and I began to suffer in the heat. I&apos;d been racing for four and a half hours and had enjoyed it all so far. I&apos;d been feeling great: running smoothly, feeling strong on the climbs and  staying top of my nutrition and hydration. Now it was mid morning and there wasn&apos;t much shade as we climbed out of the forest. Lots of people started to pass me on the climbs, including people I&apos;d overtaken earlier on. The woman I&apos;d been running with disappeared over the distant horizon. I had my poles out to help on the climbs but should have put them away here as I ended up power hiking sections I should have run, or I ran awkwardly with my poles in one hand. Gemma overtook me on one of these undulations, looking very strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the next aid station at Pico de Nieve I again stupidly declined the offer of a cold shower. Ensuring I kept cool wasn&apos;t something I was used to doing and my inexperience showed here. On the climb up to the high point I slowed even more as I was so hot. It felt like I was slowly roasting, and my body was unable to move any faster. But I was mentally holding it together and was drinking lots and eating at planned intervals. I kept putting one foot in front of the other. Relentless forward progress. I finally wobbled into the tent at the Roque de los Muchachos aid station and was immediately taken to sit down by some volunteers. They poured cold water over my head and neck from a saucepan. I wished I could cut all my hair off to keep it off my neck! I ate some fruit and left as soon as I could stand without assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d been looking forward to the descent but didn&apos;t enjoy the first part of it. I still wasn&apos;t feeling great and was being too cautious. I was scared of slipping and picked each step carefully. That&apos;s no way to run down a hill. A few guys flew past me kamikaze style. The marathon runners were catching up now and their race finished down at the beach so they weren&apos;t holding back on the descent! One guy kept passing me and then stopping to stretch, so I&apos;d pass him and we&apos;d do it all again. It was too hot to get annoyed so each time I calmly pulled aside and let him go past. Slowly I started to feel better and flow down the descent more comfortably. Every time there was an easier section I made sure I took a drink. I was on Active Root by now and it tasted amazing. I started to reel people in, including Gemma. She&apos;d bashed her knee and it meant she was having to be cautious downhill. At the aid station at El Time I got doused in cold water again, ate some orange and took some more water. The descent was too fast and furious to think about eating real food outside of the aid stations and I was a little sick of Rice Crispy Squares by this point. Fruit and Clif Shot Bloks were going down ok. I left the aid station as Gemma arrived and told her I&apos;d see her on the final ascent, fully expecting to be caught. I&apos;d been climbing so badly up to Roque I didn&apos;t know how the last climb would go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew past the lady I&apos;d been running with back at El Pilar. I had thought she was long gone. It made me realise how important it is to keep moving, however bad you feel and however slowly you think you&apos;re moving. Everyone has highs and lows in a long race and you should never consider yourself beaten. Thoughts were passing through my mind quickly as my focus had to keep returning to the manic descent. It was breathless and never-ending (it took me over 2 hours!) We dropped from over 2400m to sea level in 17km. My ears popped on the way down! Towards the end we ran down the VK route: super steep road, then steep cobbled switchbacks with a huge drop into the sea on one side. It was awesome and relentless and required all my tired focus. I almost fell about twenty times, stabbing a rock with my foot and just catching myself before smashing face first into the rock. I ran with a massive goofy grin, tongue out, loving it. I felt in my element on the cobbles, quick feet dancing downwards and catching people on every bend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally hit the seafront in Tazacorte at the same time as a marathon runner (who looked much more wiped out than I felt!) I high-fived him and ran through the marathon finish line and into the final aid station amidst huge cheers and a pumping baseline. Another cold shower, more fruit, and I took off onto the beach and the dry stony riverbed. It was more runnable than I&apos;d thought it would be. I ran / walked, hopping over rocks when I could, catching people. It was over quickly and I climbed up to the road and the final switchbacks. I didn&apos;t bother with poles and hiked, hands on knees, drinking frequently and running the flat sections between climbs. I felt like a different person from a few hours before and climbing felt easy again (although I was wary of pushing too hard as I didn&apos;t want to overheat again).  I overtook a handful of guys who looked totally beat. I didn&apos;t know how many switchbacks there were but never let myself think I might be on the last one, or about the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I reached the road into Los Llanos and started to run (it felt super fast but was actually 8:40 mile pace!) I&apos;d walked up and down this road in the heat of the day during the week and I knew how long it could feel, but it felt so good to be moving freely again after so much climbing and descending. I ticked off the things as I ran past them - the Chinese Bingo (not what I thought it was), the stadium, the supermarket, the first arch. People appeared from everywhere to line the street, there were children eating ice creams holding out sticky hands for high-fives and men dashing out of bars for high-fives when they saw me running past. It felt exhilarating (and the celebrations went on all through the evening and into the night, so every finisher was made to feel like a hero!). I slowed and high-fived as many people as I could and crossed the finish line feeling overjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished in 10 hours 26 minutes. 17th female and 101st overall. I finished totally in love with the race, the island and people of La Palma and the whole incredible experience. And I finished feeling proud of how I ran and with lots of ideas for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some thank yous: firstly to Matt for his unwavering confidence in what I can do, even when I don&apos;t believe it myself. To Adrian for the pre-race wisdom, and to Stewart Liesnham and Karl Zeiner for patiently answering all my pre-race questions. And finally to Bob, who didn&apos;t make it to the finish this year (but will be back in 2020) and was my inspiration throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In true ultra style I broke it down. The race in its entirety was too scary. There&apos;s a lot of climbing in the first 10 miles, then some ridge running with lots of spiky bits (both in profile and on the trail itself), then a huge descent to the sea. And for good measure there&apos;s a final 300m climb up to the finish (because finishing back at the sea would be too easy...) I also knew that a fair amount of the climbing would be done on black sand, and that it was likely to be hot. These were all things I could prepare for, with Matt&apos;s help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training had been building since Tenerife. The block up to Glentress went well and my body was coping ok with the higher mileage and harder sessions. The big shift since Glentress is in how I&apos;ve approached the training. It took a weekend away in the lakes with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pyllonultra.com/&quot;&gt;Pyllon team&lt;/a&gt; for me to really commit to the process. Before I was running the reps, but I wasn&apos;t pushing it, I wasn&apos;t giving it everything. I was always holding back, too scared of failing to really try. The weekend away inspired me. Being surrounded by so much positivity and amazing people, hearing so many tales of bravery, success and failure, made me think I could achieve something awesome too. I came away hungry to try. It took a few weeks of tough grinding to feel the change. I had some dreadful sessions and endured some terrible long runs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BvcA-qQgYAa/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&quot;&gt;Thirty something miles on the 3 Lochs Way&lt;/a&gt; that ended in an uphill slog in the wrong direction in horizontal rain and having to be rescued running down the main Loch Lomond road was a particular low point, but I survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally something clicked. I attribute it partly to the change in weather and the clock change. The weekend the clock&apos;s changed I repeated my least favourite session from my last training block. Three reps of Tinto Hill, pushing the final descent and back up to the gate hard after that. I was dreading it. However the conditions were much better than before. There was no ice or snow. It was daylight. It wasn&apos;t 6am on a Tuesday. Also I felt much better this time. I knew I was stronger and I knew I could complete the session. So although I approached it with a sense of foreboding, there was some optimism mixed in. My criteria for this session to be a success was to run all the way to the top at least once. I set off slowly, but running. I ignored the pain in my legs and I ignored the voice inside my head. From halfway up the voice was too loud to ignore so I argued with myself instead and kept running. Eventually I could see the top of the hill at the edge of my vision. I didn&apos;t let myself look at it, and kept running. I ran all the way to the trig-point and threw my arms around it (to the great surprise of the group of walkers already there). The next 2 reps included some walking, but that was ok. Overall I definitely ran more than I walked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my turning point. The following day I ran the Sidlaw Skyline from Dundee to Perth with some friends. There was a huge section in the middle where we trudged uphill though heather, not sure where we were, unable to find a path and going nowhere fast. It took over 7 hours to run 33 miles. It should have been awful, but the combination of good weather, good company an a positive attitude meant it was great fun. The following weekend I raced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.endurancelife.com/exmoor&quot;&gt;32 mile ultra down in Exmoor&lt;/a&gt; (north Devon). I won with a big gap and was 4th overall in a new female course record and inside the old men&apos;s one. More importantly I felt strong throughout and climbed well. A few more weeks of big mileage culminating in a 100 mile week with the Arran trip at the end and I got to my taper feeling great.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d been spending twenty minutes a week in the sauna, which in hindsight isn&apos;t very much, but it was at least some effort to train for the heat... So It had been a good build up but I was worried about the two weeks preceding the race as they involved a lot of travel. I vowed to stay as relaxed as possible. I spent a weekend racing in Ireland with Carnethy, a day at home, a few days in the Lakes for the La Sportiva UK team meetup and then straight out to Madrid for a few days. I tried not to get too stressed by being in a big busy city, and with everything breaking at work. Finally I flew to La Palma and could relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a week on the island before the race. The first few days I braved the scary mountain roads in my tiny hire car driving on the wrong (right) side of the road and hugging the outside of each bend, praying there would be nothing coming the other way. I sought out bits of the course and ran and hiked to familiarise myself with the trail and the heat, and to appreciate the views without the excitement of race day. I watched videos from previous years and thoroughly scared myself. Then I caught up with Bob Allison at the VK and he put my mind at ease about most of my worries. And also gave me some perspective - he has a serious medical condition and was preparing to spend the day chasing cut offs. Yet he was here in La Palma, excited and ready to give it everything he had. I needed to be more like Bob. I received an email from Adrian that inspired me again, with advice to &quot;run the race not the occasion&quot;. I realised I&apos;d got carried away worrying about the spectacle of it. Ultimately it was just a trail race and it was going to be awesome. I&apos;d spent the week wishing I wasn&apos;t tapering and could be out running on the beautiful trails. On race day I would finally get the chance to run without abandon. I was excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We descended down to the coast at Corrie and turned left along the road. From Sannox Will and Ali, who were only joining for the day, turned back into the hills and ran back to Brodick via Glen Rosa. Aisling, Eoín and I continued along the coast. As the others disappeared, the enormity of what we were doing hit us and we ran quietly for a while. Wide gravel track soon became more interesting single track, reminiscent of the Fife Coastal Path. As we approached the north of the island we decided to cut the corner as we&apos;d been advised that the path around the northern edge barely existed. Instead we climbed up a hill and traversed around another, then had a fun run down into Lochranza at the north of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heat was taking its toll by now and we were delighted to find a cafe and were revived by coke and cookies. From here we only had another 10 km to go and we were making better progress than we&apos;d realised. From Lochranza the trail wound uphill, away from the road and into the woods. It was an awful almost-path at an awkward camber, full of spiders&apos; webs and low hanging branches. It was impossible to get into a rhythm of running. When we finally dropped down to the road we found we were covered in ticks. Most of them brushed off easily, but we remained paranoid about ticks for the rest of the trip! The road was a relief after this and we settled in to the final few miles to our B and B at Pirnmill. It felt like the end of a triathlon: running in a beautiful location on an empty road. We were running tired but still moving swiftly and smoothly. The sun burned down on us and the road and we were glad to reach the village. Arriving at the B and B after a long 25 mile run was an anticlimax as our host was out and had left the the house open and a note on the door! The sea looked inviting so we climbed across some rocks for a paddle. It was much colder than it looked and we weren&apos;t very brave so only went in up to our knees! After an early dinner at the only restaurant in the village (it was packed!) we watched some dolphins (or possibly porpoises) jumping in pairs in the sea. We retired feeling good about the first day&apos;s run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we ate breakfast whilst watching red squirrels play in front of the house. Aisling had discovered an unwelcome visitor in the form of a tick in her leg and set about removing it before we set off. We started on the road and saw some seals playing near the shore. Then we scrambled and hopped over some rocks before reaching Blackwaterfoot, where we stopped for espressos and scones. Revived by caffeine and sugar we went back onto the rocks. In places rocks had been placed as stepping stones so you had to take small fast steps and maintain momentum to get across them. In others there was no path and you had to pick a line across rocks and sand. It was great fun but slow progress!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coastal route took us past some caves and we explored the King&apos;s Cave (which may have been where Robert the Bruce encountered a spider). We didn&apos;t see any spiders but there were lots of cool carvings in the rock. It was low tide so we had to rejoin the road after this as the coastal path around the south of the island was inaccessible. The road was hilly but the scenery had changed: steep hills and dramatic crags had been replaced by rolling hills and grassy pastures. We learnt that Arran sits on the highland boundary fault like the Scottish mainland. As we traveled south we were reaching the Borders! We soon came across our second stop of the day: a delightful Vèlo cafe. We topped up on cold drinks and suncream before another long stretch on the road. Our final section was up and into a forest. Eoín unexpectedly pushed the pace on the climb. I gave chase but didn&apos;t have much turn of speed on tired legs in the heat! We detoured from the path to check out the best waterfall on Arran (which was better than we&apos;d been imagining). The next detour was more annoying as the path we had planned to take down to the coast was fenced off. This meant a few extra miles on forest track before we dropped down to Whiting Bay. We stopped half a mile from our B and B to enjoy a beer in the sunshine. As soon as we stopped moving I started shivering from the cold wind and ended up sitting in the sun with my jacket and gloves on! We wobbled along to finish for the day after 31 miles (with almost half of that on road).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last morning was very relaxed. Breakfast didn&apos;t start until late and we didn&apos;t have far to go. We started our victory leg with a climb up into the forest and followed a fire road to Lamlash. Already the sun was scorching and the dry trail felt more like the Canaries than Scotland! We raced down to Lamlash, enjoying the descent and followed the coastal path back to Brodick. The technical rocky path here was a nice end to the trail, and we finished with delicious Arran ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great weekend and we were truly blessed by hot weather and sunshine. I hadn&apos;t expected it to be warm weather training but I&apos;m classing it as that! Running around an island is a satisfying achievement and any trip that includes a ferry journey is an adventure in my eyes. I&apos;m already planning my return for a weekend to spend a day cycling around the island and a day exploring the ridges behind Goatfell.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Glentress marathon: round and round again]]></title><description><![CDATA[After a spectacular blow up at the Glentress marathon last year I knew I had to return.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On race morning the trails were super dry so there was no confusion over shoes. My trusty La Sportiva Helios were perfect. There were lots of familiar faces around at the start and it was great to catch up with different running friends. The air was cool as we stood around but the forecast was for the sun to break through in the late morning, so I was hoping for a view at the top! As the race set off Nicola disappeared into the distance with the front pack almost immediately. I relaxed and put her out of my mind, knowing I had to run my own race. The first miles felt easy and I tried not to think about being back here at the start of the next lap. I felt comfortable on the first loop around Eagles Nest, then hit the trails climbing up to the switchbacks of the black mountain bike run. I’d forgotten how much fun the trail was: winding single track with rocks and roots, weaving in and out of the forest and across the access road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching the top of the first climb, I was still running and I still felt good. The first downhill section after that was great fun: banked switchback trails you have to lean into, trying not to decelerate too much as you double back on yourself. The downhill finished at the bottom of the hill up to the mast and I ran slowly up the stony track, then onto open hillside and a dry single track traverse to a forest. Here there was a near vertical wall but luckily I had been expecting this after hearing the half marathoners complain about it the previous day. I used it as an opportunity to eat a Clif Shot Blok whilst power hiking up. The trail weaved up and down a bit more before finally starting the long descent. There were a few guys just in front of me and I caught them up and flew past, relaxing into the downhill and loving it. Down, down, down, we danced, dodging tree stumps and rocks, savouring the dry ground. I wasn’t at all worried about slipping as the trail was so dry. Before I knew it I was back at the Eagles Nest car park. Distracted by some encouragement from a friendly marshal and Will, I took a wrong turn to head down the fireroad instead of the trail. Oops. I backtracked, laughing at myself as I rejoined the course and picked up speed again for the final wiggling section of the descent. I saw Nicola and Matthew Curry starting their second lap as I approached the turnaround. They were only a few minutes ahead and both looking strong. I ran up the hill to finish the lap, greeted Ian, the race organiser with a big smile, and took off again for round 2.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have known better. It was never going to be that easy! This is a hard race and I needed to respect that. The first gradual climb up to the Eagles Nest car park was a slog and I walked a little bit, telling myself it was ok to do this for a short while. I fought on as the trail flattened out and I enjoyed the small loop again. I stayed calm and focused on breathing and making it through each climb without expending too much energy. I ran about half of the switchbacks, then alternated between a march and an attempted run (which probably looked more like a hunchbacked shuffle by now). When I reached the top of the first big climb, Emily told me I was now about 7 minutes behind Nicola. Well, I know I’m good at descending, but I’m not that good! I tried not to worry about it. My race plan was about me and no one else. I could still run fast downhill and tried to use this time to let my glutes recover for the next uphill, but as I made my way up to the mast my run turned into a trudge and I cursed. “I’m still rubbish uphill. Why do I think I can do this? If I’m struggling now, how will I cope in the bigger, harder, hillier, races I have next?” I was so filled with self doubt that I let this get in the way of my race and I struggled to start running again on the last climbs and the traverse across to the high point. A few guys passed me here and I felt even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the high point I knew I would be ok. On the downhill I was able to put my doubt aside and focus on the moment and the race I was running. I didn’t look at my watch; time was irrelevant now. All I had to do was get down the hill as quickly as possible. Luckily I love running downhill fast. And luckily it still felt good! I flew down the trail, arms freewheeling, feet tap dancing over rocks and roots. I could do this. There were a few small uphills remaining but I cruised up them, feeling strong again. Cheers from supporters on the course had changed from “You can catch her, she’s not far ahead”, to “Well done, great running”. I acknowledged this but didn’t let it distract me and kept my focus on my race: keeping light and my footwork fast. All too soon I was at the bottom and approaching the final hill up to the wigwams. I held my head high and used my arms to power up the hill, feeling tired but strong. I finished in 3:48.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the race it took me a little while to process it and not beat myself up. Objectively I am pleased with my performance. It’s a big improvement (11 minutes) from last year. I was much stronger on the hills and I felt much better at the end. I still have a lot of room for improvement on the uphills in particular, but I have time to do that before my next race. Of course it’s hard to be objective when you’re racing a good friend and rival and I’m disappointed I wasn’t closer to Nicola in the end. However she had an amazing race and smashed the course record, finishing in 3:41. I’m super chuffed for her - good redemption for a hard race last year and definitely a great start to racing in 2019!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I’ve done some soul searching over the last few weeks and am at peace with my race. It was a good representation of where I’m at right now. I’ve come a long way in the last year but still have a long way to go. The training of the last few months is definitely paying off and this race proved that, but I’m still mentally holding myself back and not pushing as hard as I can. So, my goal for the next training block is to commit. Commit to pushing hard in each session, to being present, and to giving it my best shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Across Tenerife]]></title><description><![CDATA[The hard part of the week was over. All Elaine and I had to do was run from the south to the west coast of the island, via the mountains in the middle and over three days. We planned to run the Bluetrail ultramarathon route. A close look at the route profile the night before we started revealed we would spend the whole of day one, and the start of day two climbing up to over 3500m! To make it a little easier we skipped the initial 10km from sea level and started in Adeje as it was an easy place to leave the car for a few days. We enjoyed a very short run to leave the village, before heading uphill into a forest.

&lt;p&gt;The hard part of the week was over. All Elaine and I had to do was run from the south to the west coast of the island, via the mountains in the middle and over three days. We planned to run the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?fbclid=IwAR3tnHr3j2z2WaohixaBk8fBdPpUpdneU35-H6GLlZow_vA92SPhBJRkrNw&amp;#x26;mid=1_vQtsQcmuDavUUult_mJtkyD3JWC-xSm&amp;#x26;ll=28.250836142379%2C-16.64608050000004&amp;#x26;z=11&quot;&gt;Bluetrail ultramarathon route&lt;/a&gt;. A close look at the route profile the night before we started revealed we would spend the whole of day one, and the start of day two climbing up to over 3500m! To make it a little easier we skipped the initial 10km from sea level and started in Adeje as it was an easy place to leave the car for a few days. We enjoyed a very short run to leave the village, before heading uphill into a forest. The route followed a trail to the village of La Quinta, before winding round to Ilfonche, where we joined the GR131. Luckily Elaine had the gpx file of the route loaded onto her watch, which saved us from getting lost on more than a few occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was nervous about the first day. It was a lot of climbing and we weren’t really sure how far we had to go. I knew we would be ok once we reached Villaflor as I knew from the previous day that the trail was well marked from there. We would have daylight till about seven pm, so we should have enough daylight to make it to Parador in! However everything takes a lot longer when you’re spending most of the time hiking rather than running. The first five km took about an hour. It was hot and hard work, but there were stunning views out to sea with La Gomera, the Canary Island south of Tenerife, rising majestically out of the haze in the distance. We eventually reached Villaflor shortly before three pm, and stopped for a cold drink and to refill water. Now I was back on familiar ground and I set off confidently, keen to show Elaine the trails I’d run the day before. This time I couldn&apos;t believe I had ever managed to run up the trail. It was so steep! I didn&apos;t feel as strong today. When we reached the endless trail of black sand I got my poles out and marched up, knowing that at least this time would be the last time! Eventually we reached the final point of our climb for the day, and a sign pointing downhill to the Parador hotel. We flew down some technical switchbacks and marvelled at the amazing rock formations. It was a desert from another planet as the sun went down and the light bent in strange angles around the rocks. The trail flattened out and we meandered along, tired, hungry and almost out of water. Finally we could see a lone building in the distance, which could only be the Parador hotel! We both set off enthusiastically as the trail bent downward at a perfect angle for fast running. A little too enthusiastically and a little too early as it turned out, but we kept pushing to overtake all the walkers and finally reach the hotel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Parador hotel was large and fancy. We went straight in the swimming pool in our underwear and pretended we didn&apos;t notice the couple in the corner of the pool who we had evidently disturbed! We had an interesting dinner in the restaurant; there were no vegetarian mains so we shared a selection of starters including some Canarian specialties: salty potatoes, aubergine tempura with honey, and pumpkin cream with salty vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the morning of day two we set off up Mount Teide, the highest mountain in Spain. To get all the way to the top you need a summit pass, which had unfortunately all sold out for the year by the time we realised. But we could get up to the top of the cable car station at 3555m (a good 1500m above where we were starting the day from!) It was a relentless climb through rocks and you had to keep your eyes on the path in case it disappeared! I bonked a little on the climb and convinced myself that I was feeling the effects of altitude (really I just needed a drink). We were hoping for a cafe at the top but there was only a vending machine and crowds of people getting off the gondola. The views were spectacular and we could see across to the islands of La Gomera and La Palma in the south and Gran Canaria in the east. As the air was colder up here we didn’t stick around for long. We were both excited by the prospect of lots of downhill!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start of the descent was quite technical: steep switchbacks and lots of rocks, and hikers slowly making their way up (or some very carefully down!). It was dizzying and great fun. After the steep bit we hit a wider trail heading down through sand, and followed that to a road corner where there would be an aid station in the race. It felt like an important waypoint as it meant we had descended to the height we had started the day at! But there was still a lot further to descend before we had finished for the day. We were conscious that we hadn’t found anywhere to refill water and so were carefully rationing what we had left. Eventually the sandy trails became forest. The gpx file on the watch didn&apos;t allow us to make too many wrong turns. As we wound down through the trees the scenery around us changed from dry desert to something lusher and greener, with pines and chestnut trees. It was almost Scottish (although a lot hotter!). Eventually we found our our accommodation for the night in Los Realejos, and drank lots of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our accommodation had a swimming pool again but this one was freezing cold and we were only brave enough to go in up to the tops of our legs! We headed to the only restaurant in town, a charming pizzeria full of locals. They had gone full out for Christmas with a whole Christmas village scene, lots of Christmas lights and decorations. This was probably a lot to do with all power cuts during our meal...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final day was the short one. I&apos;d originally estimated ten km, but as looked more closely we realised it would be more like eleven miles. Still, not far and it was mainly downhill... after the initial hour long climb! This culminated in what felt like hundreds of steps, at which point I got out my poles and used both of them to help lever myself up each step! After this it was all downhill to the sea! We reached some banana plantations and picked some very green bananas (which never really ripened) then followed the coast round manmade boardwalks to eventually reach the town of Puerto de la Cruz. We ran through the busy streets, dodging tourists and street sellers to the final beach. We finished with a swim in the sea, and even remembered to stretch!&lt;/p&gt;
