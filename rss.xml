&lt;p&gt;This was going to be a post about my trip to Gran Canaria at the end of February. I was meant to be running the marathon at Transgrancanaria but my knee operation meant that wasn&apos;t possible. I went on the trip anyway and enjoyed the race weekend cheering on some friends who were running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has changed dramatically since the end of February. I can&apos;t quite muster the energy to write in much detail about that past world. It feels like a lot longer ago than a few months. However looking back at the photos have cheered me up on this stormy Saturday, and helped me recall a great few weeks of training. It was before I was able to run post-operation, so I biked, swam, aqua-jogged and hiked. Since then my knee has recovered a lot and I&apos;m now running four times a week, but still enjoying riding my bike too. I&apos;m still finding my way in this new covid-19 world, establishing new routines and exploring from my front door. One of the big lessons of the year for me so far is appreciating slowing down and not always looking to the future and rushing on to the next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training when you can&apos;t run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started each day aqua-jogging in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hellocanaryislands.com/natural-pools/gran-canaria/las-salinas-de-agaete/&quot;&gt;sea pools at Agaete&lt;/a&gt;, ten minutes walk from where I was based. It was chilly before the sun came up and I was glad to have brought a shorty wetsuit with me. I aqua-jogged in laps around one of the larger pools, quickly establishing a line that would avoid sharp rocks on the bottom. I&apos;m a bit scared of what might be underneath me when in open water, so this was a great opportunity to face that fear every morning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a morning&apos;s work I had a quick swim at lunch time (it had to be quick because the water was freezing!) and then hiked up and down the nearest hill. After work every evening I rode my bike until it got dark. I hired a road bike for the first half of my stay, and a mountain bike for the rest, both from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Cyclo-Agaete-Bike-Rental-641591279633781/&quot;&gt;Cyclo Agaete Bike Rental&lt;/a&gt;. The bikes were excellent and the price very reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the roads were smooth and empty, with lots of big climbs. I could feel myself getting stronger each time I rode! Occasionally I&apos;d make a bad route choice: what I thought from Google maps was a proper road turned out to be a gravel track. One evening I narrowly beat the darkness home after wobbling precariously along dirt trails for miles on skinny road tyres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to have some great mountain bike trails right from my doorstep that weren&apos;t too technical. To begin with I was worried my knee wouldn&apos;t cope with downhill mountain biking, but my confidence (and strength) grew each day. My regular trail started with a 40 minute uphill slog in the sun. It was worth it for the views and the downhill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my last day of mountain biking I explored some new trails that were a bit too steep and technical for me. I fell hard on my elbow and ended up with a deep cut. Luckily it was towards the end of my ride, but gave a fright to the lady who was out walking her dog nearby. Her dog ran up to me and was jumping excitedly at me, while I held my bloody elbow in the air. I think she thought her dog had bitten me! It took a few weeks of removing bits of black sand from the cut when I was back home before it healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed south for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transgrancanaria.net/&quot;&gt;Transgrancanaria&lt;/a&gt; race weekend and cheered on some friends who were running. I hired another road bike (this time from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.free-motion.com/&quot;&gt;Free Motion&lt;/a&gt; in Maspalomas) and cycled a big hilly loop on race day, passing one of the race checkpoints three times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to catch someone I knew on each loop past the checkpoint, although I missed seeing Meryl, my roommate for the weekend. She won the 30km race and was through much so quickly I hadn&apos;t arrived yet! Another friend Katie had a great race in the marathon, finishing 5th amongst a very competitive Spanish field.&lt;/p&gt;

I remember a winter session of military fitness a long time ago, running with a bib round my waist and someone using it to pull me back. I remember landing on my left foot and twisting, and sharp pain in my knee. It disrupted my training for the 2014 London marathon. I stopped running and went to see a physio. I was diagnosed with tight hips and weak glutes. Standard runner issues. Too much running, not enough strength work. I diligently did the physio exercises and swapped running for cycling. It recovered in time for me to resume training and run the marathon. But the underlying issue never fully went away and it&apos;s niggled off and on ever since. I accepted that I had a dodgy left knee and would avoid doing things to fully bend it - squat thrusts and sitting cross-legged in a certain way. It was sometimes a bit sore but crucially it didn&apos;t stop me running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first fell in love with ultramarathons I knew I needed to do something to avoid my knee getting sore again. In early 2017 I signed up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://improvemyrunning.com/&quot;&gt;Improve My Running&lt;/a&gt; to help me work on my running technique. From race photos I could see that that my left foot often comes inwards when I run. My right hip has a tendency to get very tight. I suspected the two were related and could all be part compensation for a weakness around my left knee. With Matt&apos;s help and working to make my glutes stronger, my form has improved dramatically and my foot only turns in when I&apos;m very tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good running form was not on my mind much during the 18+ hour sufferfest that was Laveredo in a heatwave last summer. I was certainly very tired and for the final few hours I was barely shuffling. After the race, my knee got sore again. I assumed that it would improve with some time off running. I rested through July and tried to return to running in August. Every time I tried to increase my mileage, my knee hurt. While at Loughborough University for a work event I spent an amazing few hours with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lboro.ac.uk/sport/physiotherapy-clinic&quot;&gt;physio&lt;/a&gt; there. She didn&apos;t know what was wrong as my knee was moving well and there was no swelling, but she threw everything she could at trying to fix it. Massage, cupping, acupuncture hooked up to electricity... Nothing helped. Back home I enlisted the help of a local physio, Kenny, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://spaceclinics.co.uk/kenny-watt/&quot;&gt;Space Clinics&lt;/a&gt;. Working with the same information - everything was moving well and there was no inflammation - he prescribed lots of glute and leg strengthening exercises. This worked, to a point. I was able to build my mileage back up and run an autumn ultra. However there were a few setbacks during the process - too many miles made my knee sore again, and meant I needed to back off for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my last race of the season I took a few weeks off, and at Kenny&apos;s suggestion, booked an MRI scan. It took a long time for various frustrating reasons and I didn&apos;t get the results until the beginning of 2020. They confirmed what I&apos;d been dreading - a tear in my medial meniscus. After several more weeks waiting to see a surgeon, things suddenly moved very quickly and I was booked in for an arthroscopy to remove the torn meniscal cartilage the following week. I was terrified and told only a few people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The operation was a week ago and went well. I still can&apos;t get my head around the fact that I was put to sleep, and someone cut my knee open, but I have the stitches to prove it! My knee mobility has been steadily improving throughout the last week. I&apos;m under strict instructions from Kenny to not walk around much. I&apos;m listening. Plus I&apos;ve felt totally wiped out after the operation and have been unable to focus on anything (this post has taken several days to finish!), so have been mainly sleeping. My knee is bruised but not too swollen. It still hurts but it&apos;s bearable and I&apos;ve cut down on the painkillers as they were making me feel too fuzzy. Sometimes I worry that it&apos;s the old pain, the same pain as before. What if the operation hasn&apos;t fixed it? Will tells me I worry too much. He may be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this week I&apos;m trying not to think too much about the rest of the year. I had big plans for 2020, and maybe some of those will need to be adjusted. That&apos;s ok. For now I&apos;m in the mountains, spending the week resting and elevating my leg while my friends ski. I&apos;m trying not to be too gutted at missing out on that and instead I&apos;m accepting where I am right now. It&apos;s not where I want to be, but it&apos;s temporary. Fitness comes and goes. I&apos;ll need to work hard soon, but I will come back stronger. The stitches come out next week and then I&apos;ll be able to start training in the pool. Hopefully I&apos;ll have enough mobility to use a turbo. Until then I&apos;ll enjoy the mountain views from my window and focus on recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took 4 trains to get us to Farnham, where the North Downs Way starts. It was dry, not too cold, and we were traveling light, excited to be free and alone after a family Christmas. Excited for another new adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set off. Road, trail, road, trail. We didn&apos;t get lost till the second mile. We checked the map and went back to where we&apos;d missed the sign. After 5 miles the trail was flooded. Water obscured the path as far as we could see. We checked the map again and found a way around on a road. We figured we&apos;d done about a mile extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route was muddy and lots of fun. Through forests on a winding trail, across rolling hills, emerging suddenly in small villages with huge houses. Sticky mud that sucked each step into it with a delightful squelch. It was my favourite sort of trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&apos;t stop to drink until two and a half hours. We&apos;d been having too much fun, but we shouldn&apos;t have waited this long. We bypassed Guildford and quickly got hungry and wished we&apos;d stopped. We were covered in mud. Finally we reached an amazing cafe at Newlands Corner called &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepluckypheasant.com/&quot;&gt;The Plucky Pheasant&lt;/a&gt;. We were the muckiest in there but there was already mud on the floor so we didn&apos;t feel out of place. We ate paninis and treated ourselves to chips, craving the warmth and saltiness. Revived by food and coke we set out again in high spirits, hoping to reach Dorking before dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;d eaten too much. For the next few miles I felt dizzy and ill and Will felt sick. We slowed considerably. I told stories of running cross country races at Denbies Wine Estate and we fantasised about arriving there. It seemed a long time coming. Finally we arrived, just ahead of the rapidly approaching darkness, and saw the shapes and lights of Dorking spread below us. Reaching the main road we turned off the trail and towards town and a hot shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a lovely evening of pizza and Star Wars, although it wasn&apos;t a real cinema and the seats had no leg room. After nearly three hours of cramped legs my knee stiffened and walking was painful. We consulted the map and decided to finish early the next day, at Merstham. It was an easy place to get a train from, and meant a much shorter run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mile on the road back to the trail in the morning was slow and painful. The same stabbing pain I&apos;d felt in my calf the previous week had returned and it made lifting my leg very difficult. Once I got into a rhythm on the flat or downhill it was manageable, but uphill was not good. I hoped it would ease off as my muscles warmed up. Unfortunately from Dorking the North Downs Way goes up Box Hill. It wasn&apos;t quite the start I was hoping for! More fortunately, it&apos;s mostly big steps, so there was little running anyway. I had a tantrum partway up, telling Will my knee was sore and I couldn&apos;t do it and it was too hard and there was no way I could run this in a single day. He suggested firmly that I pull myself together. By the time we reached the top of the hill I&apos;d snapped out of it. We chased a group of mountain bikers along some muddy trails and luckily lost them before the long gradual descent. It was great fun and we loved having the trail to ourselves here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Reigate there were people everywhere and we slowed to appreciate the final views and the last few miles. We stopped running as we entered Merstham and had time for coffee and to change into warm clothes before the train arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll be back to recce the final section soon!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pre-Christmas adventures in Lanzarote]]></title><description><![CDATA[To continue my running tour of the Canary Islands I went to Lanzarote the week before Christmas.

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first day on the island was my birthday. After a lazy breakfast we ran in the Parque National de los Volcanoes around the Caldera Blanca. It was hot, dry and dusty, on a largely flat trail with some detours up volcanic craters. We had one sketchy descent where our path disappeared and we had to scramble down the rock face. We stopped to enjoy a picnic lunch on a rock. The last few miles were on road and I felt myself speeding up involuntarily as it somehow felt like the end of a triathlon! I realised why so many road bikers come to Lanzarote. The roads are super smooth, up and down long rolling hills without too much traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A storm came in overnight and the next day was very windy and rather wet. We drove south to Femés. Rather misleadingly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cicerone.co.uk/walking-on-lanzarote-and-fuerteventura-second&quot;&gt;guidebook&lt;/a&gt; said the first part of the trail was quite exposed. We took a wrong turn and ended up on a very exposed rock face in rising wind, surprised that the guidebook would suggest a path like this even with a warning. Luckily we looked more closely at the route description and realised we were going the wrong way around a hill. We reversed to safety. The other side was far more sheltered! We combined two walks from the guidebook for an interesting run around some rocky craters. The final climb was a battle up a zig zag track into the wind, feeling like we could be back in Scotland (but a lot warmer)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third day we took a ferry to the small island of La Graciosa and ran around the easter half of it. It was a huge contrast to the previous day and was we ran in glorious sunshine on pale sandy beach all the way. We hiked up Montaña Bermeja for beautiful views across Playa de los Conchas and the ocean. I resisted the temptation to try and run around the whole island. Instead we enjoyed a lazy lunch on the beach in the sunshine before taking the ferry back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GR131 south to north&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GR131 is a long distance trail crossing all of the Canary Islands. On Lanzarote it stretches 45 miles (72km) across the island. The &quot;official&quot; way to run it is north to south and the km markers are numbered for that. This is probably sensible as it means you will be going with the prevailing wind, rather than against it. However we didn&apos;t realise this and the guidebook describes the route the opposite way, so we ran from south to north over 3 days. This time I&apos;d planned the days carefully with fewer miles on the first and last days to allow us to get to and from the trail. We parked our car in the capital city, Arrecife, and took a bus to the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Playa Blanca to Conil (18 miles)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started with our toes in the sea and narrowly avoided being soaked by a big wave. We ran out of the busy town of Playa Blanca amidst bemused looks from tourists who were lazing about in the sun. The suburbs were full of run-down buildings and wasteland, which turned into lava fields . The path cut through black sand and nothingness until the next village of Las Breñas rose out of the desert. It was the hottest day so far and Will did not enjoy the heat, the dull trail, and running with a heavy bag. I ran ahead and doubled back to him a few times, feeling surprisingly sprightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped in Yaiza for coffee and a sandwich and both got a second wind. We detoured off the path to climb a volcano as we were bored of the flat sandy path through the desert! This was much more fun, with lots of loose sand and rock at the top which made the descent interesting.

&lt;p&gt;My left knee and the muscles around it stiffened a lot overnight, which meant the first part of the run was a painful shuffle. We got very lost at Montaña Blanca due to a lack of signs and confusing directions in the guidebook. We were halfway up Montaña Blanca itself when we realised we should be much lower and heading to the village of the same name. I decided to climb to the top anyway. From the village the route took a convoluted wiggle around several volcanoes to eventually reach San Bartolomé, which we could see ahead for ages. The main road we&apos;d been on not too long before went directly to it and we grew irritated with the guidebook and whoever made the GR route! We continued on to the old capital of Teguise, growing increasingly hot and tired. Finally we arrived and found a shady cafe for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We climbed from Teguise to the highest point of the island (Peñas del Chache at 672m). We didn&apos;t go quite that high as it&apos;s out of bounds, but reached over 600m, which isn&apos;t very high at all! There were lots of people hiking around the top and cars parked in surprising places off the road, but the GR signs kept us straight here. Finally we could see the village of Haría below us. The descent to it was the best running we had all week - the trail dropping sharply through rocks and cutting across switchbacks in the road, skipping over boulders and bushes. I danced down, loving it. We finished with ice cream, coke and chocolate milk in the quirky mountain town of Haría.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Haría to Órzola (7.5 miles)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My delight at the final descent the previous day had led me to be quite reckless as I ran down and forget about protecting my left knee. I spent the evening massaging the calf which had tightened and was made it painful to straighten my leg. I was worried I wouldn&apos;t be able to run at all but managed a slow shuffle to start. Every time I lifted my leg there was a sharp, stabbing pain at the top of my calf where it went into the knee joint. Luckily the route was mostly downhill to the sea at Órzola. After the muscle warmed up the pain eased and I could get into a rhythm, using gravity and momentum to push me forwards. I channelled all my thoughts into running with good form and trying to keep my left foot and arm doing the right thing. Finally we reached the final km marker of the GR131 and not long after, the port of Órzola and the end of our journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely holiday, but I have to confess that Lanzarote is my least favourite Canary Island so far. Apart from scattered volcanoes it was very flat, and the trails were quite uninteresting and same-y. Whereas other islands have forests and lots of trees, Lanzarote was mostly desert, and I missed the variety. However the weather was lovely and December was a great time to visit as it wasn&apos;t too busy or hot. If I went back I&apos;d definitely hire a road bike!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A plan that didn't come together]]></title><description><![CDATA[The end of my 2019 running season didn't quite go to plan. After a month of little running after Lavaredo I built back up slowly with the help of some great physio sessions with Kenny at Space Clinics. Matt carefully wrote me a training plan which we tweaked weekly depending on how my knee was recovering. At the beginning we didn't know if I'd be able to complete the training. But my knee slowly improved and I arrived in France ready to run the Grand Trail des Templiers feeling fit and confident. I'd recce'd the route in August and was excited to run on the trails there.]]></description><link>https://powderach.com/posts/a-plan-that-didnt-come-together</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://powderach.com/posts/a-plan-that-didnt-come-together</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

&lt;p&gt;The end of my 2019 running season didn&apos;t quite go to plan. After a month of little running after Lavaredo I built back up slowly with the help of some great physio sessions with Kenny at &lt;a href=&quot;https://spaceclinics.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Space Clinics&lt;/a&gt;. Matt carefully wrote me a training plan which we tweaked weekly depending on how my knee was recovering. At the beginning we didn&apos;t know if I&apos;d be able to complete the training. But my knee slowly improved and I arrived in France ready to run the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.festivaldestempliers.com/courses/templiers/&quot;&gt;Grand Trail des Templiers&lt;/a&gt; feeling fit and confident. I&apos;d recce&apos;d the route in August and was excited to run on the trails there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas it wasn&apos;t to be this year. I woke up at 1am on race morning to an email titled &quot;Annulation Grand Trail des Templiers&quot;. The race was cancelled! I ran it through Google Translate a few times to be sure. The Facebook post announcing the same had been shared over 1,000 times and had as many comments (mainly in angry French as far as I could tell). After a confused few hours convincing myself that this was real, I went back to sleep. The weather later in the day was the most extreme I&apos;ve ever been in, with huge storms and lightning directly overhead. Cancellation was absolutely the right decision by the organisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still disappointed and full of energy though! I had a stressful week in France and all sorts of travel troubles trying to get home. Meanwhile Matt was busy in the background finding me a race to run for the big end of season finale...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.highterrainevents.co.uk/ennerdale-ultra-trail&quot;&gt;Ennerdale Ultra Trail&lt;/a&gt; is a 50km race in the western Lake District, organised by the great team at High Terrain Events (who also organise the excellent Glentress races). It&apos;s two laps around Ennerdale Water and from the course description sounded very fast and runnable.  Matt looked at race times from previous years and suggested I aim to run 4 hours 30. It seemed reasonable when I broke that down, and 50km was much shorter than what I&apos;d been training for, so I should have the endurance... but did I have the speed?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s very hard not to go out too hard. The terrain at the start was flat and runnable. I&apos;d been bouncing off the walls all week in some sort of reverse-taper madness. My legs felt good and fast felt easy. I tried to reign myself in. After the first few miles I ran alone. It was cold and drizzly but the views across the lake were stunning. The loop climbed gradually to Black Sail where there was a water station. I ran straight through and into the boggy section. This was quite slow but there were some long downhills to balance it out. Then the path dropped to next to the lake and became a lot more interesting: hopping over rocks and a roped scramble over Anglers Crag. My plan had been to run the first lap in 2 hours 10, but this section slowed me substantially and I finished the loop in 2:14 and in 8th place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I overtook one guy in the halfway aid station as I didn&apos;t stop, and another guy who was walking just after it. He managed to hang on to me for a mile or so, but dropped back on the climb. I kept running but was annoyed to be moving much slower than on the first lap. I was feeling low from about mile 19 until just after Black Sail. I got a huge boost here from the encouragement from Ian the Race Director who had mountain biked around. By the time I got to the downhill section I was feeling strong and ran this much faster on the second lap, passing another guy. I caught the next guy as we reached the technical section and managed to lose him on this. It was tiring to constantly hop over rocks but I was feeling good again, and was pushing so hard I almost cramped up when I had to slow for the scramble! I knew I wasn&apos;t going to finish under my target but I kept pushing on to the finish and came in at 4:33.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleased to finish 1st female and 4th overall. My second lap was 5 minutes slower than the first, which isn&apos;t perfect, but much better than most others in the race! It was a good finish to the season: I&apos;ve learned lots from running some big international races but it&apos;s always nice to race a bit closer to home! I&apos;m looking forward to a rest from racing now and starting on some strength training to build up to a big 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain biking was not my first choice. However I picked up a knee niggle after Lavaredo and haven&apos;t run much since, so it seemed the safest option. In a previous life I did a fair bit of mountain biking and I&apos;m not bad at it. I spent a summer leading kids on mountain bike trails in the Redwoods of California, but that was a long time ago (and on very cruisey trails). I&apos;d borrowed a mountain bike to use for the summer to give my legs a rest after the Dolomites, but I wasn&apos;t very confident with it. On my first outing to the Pentlands the back tyre exploded which wasn&apos;t a great sign. I also wasn&apos;t confident about how my knee would hold up to 4 days of heavy activity. The physio had encouraged keeping active but there&apos;s a chance she didn&apos;t fully appreciate what my weekend plans entailed. Still, I was willing to give the adventure my best shot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 1 - Garve to Oykel Bridge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set off from Garve in glorious sunshine. After an initial deviation from the route which ended in carrying the bike through bushes and over a fence, we quickly learnt that we should trust the GPS. The route for the first day was all on Landrover tracks. It was very easy to roll along on a mountain bike but not such a fun run for Elaine as the surface was hard and lacking in variety. I stopped frequently for her to catch up. This doubtless encouraged Elaine to run faster than she should have on day 1 of a multi day long run! But the weather was fabulous and the views stunning so we were not in a rush. We saw some herds of deer and stopped to listen to  them calling to each other. It felt like we were miles from civilisation and we saw no one. The navigation was easy and we arrived at the finish line in good time. To make it easier for Janet we continued on to Oykel Bridge and finished at a pub there. For this last section Elaine rode the bike and I ran (as it wasn&apos;t strictly on the route). It was easy undulating trail and my knee felt fine. I ran fast to avoid the bike getting too far ahead and understood why Elaine felt like she had been running slowly all day! We waited a while for Janet who arrived flustered and unimpressed with the google directions which had led her down a private road with a locked gate, meaning a long drive round to meet us! We stayed even further north in Lairg and were joined later by Tim and Jackie and shared a bottle of wine. It was an excellent first day of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 2 - Oykel Bridge to Inverbroom Lodge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 started on a decent Landrover track with some steep sections. My uphill mountain bike strategy was &quot;point and pedal&quot; and I was pleased to find that my legs were still strong from my month in the mountains, and in the lowest gear I could ride up slopes far steeper than I expected. We had an ambitious plan to take a fifteen km detour up a Munro (I planned to leave the bike at the bottom) but we arrived at the turnoff for it in thick mist and decided it was a silly idea! This turned out to be a very good call as the day got rapidly more difficult and energy sapping. We rolled down to a small lochearn with a lonely boat hugging its shore, then headed off path and into bog. I carried the bike down a steep tussocky slope to a river, across it and back up the other side. We laughed about it, not realising that this was to become the new pattern for the afternoon. But first some technical single track with a steep drop off on the left. It looked great fun to run but I was a little nervous on the bike. Luckily my good right leg was my uphill leg so I could use it to push off sections and I managed to stay on the bike (and on the trail)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day got wetter as we headed even further off path to follow the Cape Wrath trail. It seemed to be mainly unmarked but the GPS told us we were on track. We came across a hiker going in the opposite direction. He told us that we had a lot more off-path and boggy sections to come. He was right. The next three hours were a long slog through bog, across tussocky ground and up steep grassy banks. I pushed the bike when I could and carried it on my shoulder when I couldn&apos;t. A few times we climbed up things that were so steep the weight of the bike toppled me over. It was intermittently raining but quite warm. Elaine told me afterwards that the views were good, but I struggled to focus on anything other than keeping the bike on my shoulder and keeping moving. My sore knee did not enjoy the off camber weighted hike. Yet somehow we stayed in good spirits and kept smiling. This was all part of the adventure, and that&apos;s what we&apos;d signed up for! Finally we reached Inverlael Forest and gravel tracks. I jumped back on the bike and freewheeled down, savouring the easy descents. We made up some extra distance in the forest here and finished feeling strong and happy as the sun came back out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting out of bed on the morning of day 3 was very difficult. My arms and back were very stiff from all the bike carrying! I wasn&apos;t sure how much more of that I&apos;d be able to do. However we&apos;d looked at the next part of route and thought that after the first section it should all be rideable. I made a last minute decision to run the first section with Elaine rather than wait around for her with the bike. We spent the first ten minutes trying to reunite a lamb with its mother. It had ended up in a neighbouring field and we came across them bleating at each other in distress and eventually managed to coax the lamb through a gate to rejoin the other sheep. Running together was much more fun and much more social than biking as our pace was more evenly matched. However I had to check my ego on the descent and let Elaine fly ahead. I picked my way down more cautiously in order to protect my left knee. After ten km we reached a road crossing where Janet had left the bike. I picked that up and we started on a big climb up a wide track. It got very steep with lots of loose gravel so I ended up pushing the bike for most of it. As the track got steeper and rockier still we were amazed to see three Landrovers pass us! We hadn&apos;t seen anyone else all day and it seemed very wrong to see these machines cutting through the landscape here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the big climb we had a fun gravelly descent and found the Landrovers at the end of the road. There were people standing around them looking like they were preparing to go deer stalking. We left them behind and turned onto onto a wet and muddy singletrack. It was bikeable but slow and Elaine had to keep looping back for me. We followed along a river until our route suddenly crossed it. It was both deeper and wider than we expected and the water came up over our knees. I waded across with the bike on my shoulder and was glad that the water wasn&apos;t flowing very fast! Our final climb of the day was steep, rocky and technical so I had to carry the bike up most of it. It was very hard work. The descent was similarly steep, rocky and technical but luckily not too narrow. My downhill mantra became &quot;It&apos;s gonna be ok&quot; and I repeated this to myself as I rolled down big boulders and somehow stayed on the bike, just about balancing on the right side of control. It was definitely the most technical trail I&apos;ve ever ridden and I reached the bottom in disbelief that I&apos;d made it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow I stayed on the bike down this trail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we crossed the causeway between Dubh Loch and Fionn Loch I realised I had a puncture in the back tyre (not that surprising after the big descent!) We changed the inner tube and put the wheel back on but now something was very wrong with the bike. It would no longer freewheel. The pedals turned with the wheel but not in a useful way that would move the bike if I tried to ride it. We&apos;d been out for around seven hours by this time and wondered if we&apos;d somehow put the wheel on wrong because we were tired, but tried it a few times and it was still broken. I started to push and Elaine valiantly settled in to walk with me. After a few miles we realised this was a very slow way to travel and Janet was going to be worried about us. Also we were going to miss our dinner booking, which was a real concern as we were running out of food and getting hungry! Elaine ran on ahead to try and get phone signal to organise things. I kept pushing the bike and &quot;riding&quot; downhill - sitting on the saddle with my legs out to keep out of the way of the pedals, with the back brake on enough to stop the chain coming off. It wasn&apos;t the most comfortable but it meant I covered the downhill a lot quicker than on foot! I made it through the forest and was on the Landrover track heading towards Poolewe when Elaine and Janet rescued me in the car. Luckily we&apos;d been able to reschedule dinner and after warm shower and a pizza, all was well again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 4 - near Poolewe - near Torridon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long chat with Adam the bike expert / owner I understood what the problem was with the back wheel and how to fix it. It took a lot of patience but I eventually managed to do so and we began the final morning without too much delay. It was wet from the start and the forecast was for it to get wetter. It wasn&apos;t the ideal end to our adventure but perhaps the most fitting for the north of Scotland (in July)! We set off amidst a cloud of midges onto some challenging technical paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was so much water on the trail that it felt like riding through a river. I got a second back puncture  but this time changed the tube and got the wheel back on without any drama (except being eaten alive by midges). This first trail section took us longer than we&apos;d anticipated but we finally reached the A832. Elaine crossed the road and set off onto another trail. Her route involved a big off-path section between trails that would be silly to attempt on a bike. I set off to go the long way round on the road to intercept her at the next road crossing on the A896. My &quot;easy&quot; ride here was 18 miles up and down hills in lashing rain and wind. I enjoyed being able to ride fast on the smooth surface but cars sped past me too close and too fast and I worried for my safety. I stopped at the gas station in Kinlochewe for a much-needed espresso before the final 6 miles into a headwind on the road to Torridon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the bike partway down the road and set off to meet Elaine. I started out in good spirits, looking forward to company and sharing tales of our separate adventures. As I neared the point where she would be joining the path and there was still no sign of her I started to get worried. Visibility was about twenty metres and I definitely didn&apos;t want to step off the path and be swallowed up by the mist. I was soaked through and starting to get cold so I put on all the clothes I had in my pack, including full waterproofs. I blew my whistle and shouted for Elaine. After some minutes of this I started back towards the road. I had to keep moving to keep myself warm. If I got all the way back to the road without Elaine catching me I could hail down a car and give them Janet&apos;s number so she could come to meet us, then I could head back out to search for Elaine once I was warm. I went back slowly and cautiously, often pausing to look back and shout and whistle. I tried not to worry too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Finally, less than a mile from the road I heard Elaine shouting my name. We were so relieved to see each other again! Elaine had had a far worse time than I had done, with little visibility, water logged ground and lots of deep river crossings. I was so impressed she&apos;d been able to find the path and her way back! We ran down to the road together and luckily Elaine had enough phone signal to reach Janet who came to our rescue in the car. We were due to finish in Achnashellach but were so cold and wet that we made the sensible decision to call it a day!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily there was a hot shower, hot food and entertaining stories waiting for us in Strathcarron, and hosts who didn&apos;t mind that we arrived a few hours later than we planned! It didn&apos;t take long to feel human again. However it took longer to forget the feeling of being scared and alone on the hill in bad weather, not knowing where your friend is. It was a good lesson for us both. Luckily it all ended well and was a great adventure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time I&apos;ll definitely run rather than bike...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start line was rammed and I let myself get carried along, moving with the taller people in the dark, careful not to get a pole in the face. We ran through the crowds and up out of town. I kept running on the uphill roads, knowing we’d head onto track after a mile and a half. Poles were produced and waved around. I kept my head down and started hiking. Soon I came across Ryan Hogben who was moving fast uphill as he’d got boxed in at the start. We fell into what felt like an easy pace and ran along chatting, overtaking lots of people. In hindsight this was probably too fast. We were running uphill when we should have been walking. It was lovely to have company in the dark though and these miles flew by and we were at the first high point at Forcella Pospocora in no time. The descent from here was fairly technical but we cruised down it, letting faster people pass when they got too close behind. We reached the first aid station together in just under 2 hours. Ryan said that was about what he was aiming for. I worried it was a little fast, but didn’t really know so stayed relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my poles out for the next climb and Ryan pulled ahead. In the dark the climbing didn’t feel too tough. When I’d recced this part a few weeks before there had been a lot of snow but now it was all clear. As I ran down to Tre Croci I realised I hadn’t eaten anything and had half a rice crispy square. By this point it was about 2am and my body was not convinced eating was a good idea. It was mainly downhill from here to the next aid station at Federreveccia and I tried to relax. This path had been almost impassable on my recce due to fallen trees but they had all been cleared away now and the trail underneath was soft and spongy and easy running. At the second aid station I got worried that I had lost my cup. This kept haunting me throughout the race (much later I took a plastic one from an aid station, and later still found my original cup stuffed in my pack underneath a soft flask). Now I worried. The next climb felt ok and I remembered hiking up it previously with Will and trying to avoid a storm. I wasn’t feeling great on the run down to Lake Misurina and was nervous about tripping over a tree root in the darkness, but I made it down safely. I started to struggle on the climb after the lake, but it was starting to get light and turning off my headtorch made me feel better. The snow was gone here too and the climb was very different to the one we’d done some weeks before - we’d tried to follow footprints through the snow and ended up on the other side of the road!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of females overtook me at the top of the climb, including Anna-Marie Watson, another British female. She had been tipped to do well in the race and I had a sinking feeling that I should probably not have gone out ahead of someone with so much more experience! Still, I felt stronger after the aid station, where I had a few mouthfuls of noodle soup. I had a bit of a headache but the saltiness of the soup made that subside. I also switched Tailwind for Active Root in one of my soft flasks and this went down a lot better. Running alongside Tre Cime as the sun came up was incredible. There was low cloud hanging in the valley to the right and the views were stunning. Lots of people stopped to take photos, but I assumed there were photographers around who would do a much better job than I would with my average camera phone, and continued. The traverse after the saddle was on a lovely runnable trail, totally different from when we’d recced it in deep snow. The snow-free descent was also a lot of fun and quite technical in places. I passed Anna-Marie here, but figured she would soon catch me back, and I was right - she passed me running easily on the gradual uphill cycle track in to the aid station at Cimabanche. I was running with Ryan again and we were both struggling, running bits and walking bits. It concerned me that I felt like this already, but I was looking forward to the aid station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cimabanche was the drop bag point, just after halfway. I was pleased to get there, but didn’t know what to do with either my drop bag or myself. I didn’t want anything in the bag. I got another bowl of noodle soup and had a few more mouthfuls, and some coke. I wasn’t feeling great and knew I hadn’t eaten much, and it was soon going to get hot, which wouldn’t help. Sophie Grant arrived as I was about to leave the aid station, looking fresh, and I knew I’d see her again soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next climb was one I hadn’t recced. It looked small on the course profile but still took about 45 minutes to reach the top. My plan of only using poles for some of the steep climbs had gone out the window and I was relying on them heavily to help me on all the ascents. I struggled to run down the other side. My legs and feet were hurting and I was starting to have serious doubts about the race. I made it to the next aid station at Malga Ra Stua. People say the race starts from here. That wasn’t a good sign as I was already feeling awful. There was still about 50km to go and I was barely running. I stopped at a fountain to douse myself in water. It was already hot and I had learned a good lesson about keeping cool at Transvulcania. Sophie caught me here and also stopped to cool off in the fountain. She set off running strongly up the hill in front of me while I settled in to walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big traverse round to Val Travenanzes (Death Valley) was long and difficult in the heat. Then there was no shade in Death Valley and it went on forever. Luckily the path through was well marked, which meant less river crossings than when I’d recced it, and the river was lower too. The river crossings were lovely and I took my time over them, savouring the cold water, and at one point sat down in the river (probably a bad call as I had bad chafing  after that!). The final climb out of the valley went on for ages and lots of people passed me. I felt very demoralised. I was calculating in my head how long it would take me to reach the finish, but I was only moving at about 3km an hour and that was far too long to think about properly, so I went back to thinking about the next aid station. If I could make it to Col Gallina then I could do it. It wasn’t going to be pretty and it was going to take a very long time, but I could do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could barely run down from the top of the climb, or on the next descent to Col Gallina, but I made it there. Greg from La Sportiva was by the entrance to the aid station cheering, but I told him I was broken (actually I said something much less polite than that). He was impossibly cheery and told me I was doing great, which I knew was a lie. One of the women who’d passed me on the descent was still in the aid station and she came over to check I was ok and told me I needed to eat something. I tried a little more soup. I didn’t want to stay for long or I would never leave this nice shady place, so I headed out the tent and forced myself to run the initial downhill. I was boosted by support from Matt Wilson before the trail started to climb up to Averau. This climb wasn’t too bad, but I was moving super slowly and not even running on the flatter bits. Averau was an interim aid station and they had iced tea and a very welcome cold shower. There was much less water on this side of the mountain. I had mistakenly thought it was downhill from here to Passo Giau, but there was a big traverse and another climb before the descent into the aid station. It was hot and neverending. Everyone came past me and I stood aside and waved them by, trying to stay cheerful. I had no fight left. I ate some fruit at Passo Giau and mixed up some more Active Root. There were two more climbs from here to the next aid station, then it was all downhill into Cortina. I could do it. I was convinced I saw Eóin running out of this aid station, which was a little surprising as he wasn’t in the race, but I thought maybe he was there to take photos. I tried calling his name and shouting after him but couldn’t catch him. He also swears it wasn’t him. I tried to chat with a Canadian guy who was moving about the same pace as me but he didn’t seem interested so I resigned myself back to my own thoughts. They were not particularly pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interim checkpoint here was between the two climbs. Everyone else was running on the flatter section but I just picked my way along slowly with my poles. One foot in front of the other. I was going to make it. I wobbled a bit and the marshal let me finish his bottle of coke. Some elderly walkers overtook me on the way up the final climb and stopped to check I was ok. I was so embarrassed. Every time I caught someone’s eye they had to look away. I’m rubbish at hiding my feelings and my pain and humiliation was written all over my face. I don’t know why or how I was still moving, but I wasn’t going to give up. I wanted to finish despite how hard it was. I was inspired by Aisling who’d suffered through her race the previous day but had kept going and finished and I thought that was incredible. I needed to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggled to breathe in the heat. A full breath made me cough so with each breath I only half filled my lungs. This meant I was constantly fighting the urge to panic as I wasn’t breathing calmly. I had never realised before how much I rely on deep breathing to keep myself calm and in control. The last climb was only short but very steep. I felt lightheaded by the top and had to pause before starting down the other side.  Finally I arrived at the last checkpoint. It was all downhill from here. I had no elation or relief as I knew this would still take me well over an hour at my current pace, but there was a photographer on the way out of this checkpoint and I held my head high. I was going to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last descent was not pretty and it went on for much longer than I thought it would. Some bits were steep and technical and I was far too cautious. My feet hurt and running hurt and I wanted it all to be over. But I kept moving and not too many people passed me. I finally reached a road and the village above Cortina. Some locals had set up their own aid station and were handing out watermelon, which tasted incredible. I kept walking the ups and using gravity to help ‘run’ the descents. A British man appeared from a driveway and told me he had been tracking me all day and was so pleased I was here. I have no idea who he was, or if he was really there. I hiked up to the main street and the final run in to the finish. I paused to gather myself. I put on my sunglasses as I didn’t trust myself not to break down completely (and I wanted to maintain some pride), and started to run. Given that I had barely run at all in the previous 10 hours, I was surprised at how easy it seemed. I high fived some people and kept running. I heard my name called by Aisling, Eóin and Lynne and I smiled. I finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My emotions are still pretty raw and it&apos;s still hard to objectively look at my race. I can already see there are some things that went well. I finished, when I really didn’t know if I could. I ran the furthest I’ve ever run, and for the first time all through the night. I fought on, even when I thought I had no fight left. But there are so many more things that didn’t go so well and I have a lot to learn. During the whole 18 hours 38 minutes it took me, I ate 2 rice crispy squares, 2 Clif Shot Bloks and a couple of mouthfuls of soup and fruit at the later aid stations. It&apos;s hardly surprising I had no energy later on in the race!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;18 hours of wet feet is not pretty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people didn’t finish. The heat was intense and it meant there was a high drop out rate. I not only finished, I was 15th lady and 131st overall. So many people overtook me in the latter half of the race that I felt like it was much worse. I have so much respect for everyone who ran, whether they finished or not. Running usually makes me a better person, but I’m not sure it did in this race, and that cuts pretty deep. I have some soul searching to do in the next few weeks. I&apos;m not proud of how I ran the race but I did enjoy the experience of it. Cheering Aisling and Eóin in their races was fun and it was great to hang out with the La Sportiva crew (and massive congratulations to Sophie who was 9th, and John Kelly who was 32nd overall, despite having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://randomforestrunner.com/2019/06/2019-lavaredo-120k/&quot;&gt;tough race&lt;/a&gt;). And hanging out with new Scottish friends Lachlan, Lynne and Richard before the start was great and I learnt a lot from their collective Euro racing experience! The race itself was beautiful and well organised and I&apos;d recommend it to anyone. The Dolomites are fast becoming my favourite mountains, they are truly stunning. Overall I had an amazing month living and training in the mountains and this is what I will take away from my time in the Dolomites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dolomiti Extreme Trail]]></title><description><![CDATA[Will and I signed up for the 23km race at the Dolomiti Extreme Trail to finish off a week of training (er, I mean a holiday) in the Dolomites.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled ahead of Will as we ran through the next village. I wanted to finish ahead of him but I knew it would be difficult. 23km and 1300m ascent is the sort of race where he thrives, but I was feeling super fit and wanted to push on the hills to see how I could do. After the first few small bumps we reached the big climb up to Col de le Ole at 1450m. I got my poles out at the bottom here - they weren&apos;t really necessary but I wanted the practice! It was a wide gravel track with switchbacks, so I alternated between hiking the steep sections with the poles and running the flatter bits with the occasional stab at the floor with the poles and pretending I was a train (translation: looking like a massive idiot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an unexpected aid station two thirds of the way up the climb (officially there was only meant to be one, but it seemed every village wanted to join in). After this the climb got very steep and rocky. I was spurred on by a 64 year old German man who told me I was a &quot;very good runner&quot; as he overtook me (although I didn&apos;t fully trust this compliment as he&apos;d only seen me hiking up the hill). Whenever I looked back on a switchback I could see Will not too far behind me, alongside a lady in a yellow tshirt. I didn&apos;t want either of them to catch me!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we reached the top and ran along a narrow ridge before dropping down into a forest. The descent was great: not too steep or technical which meant you could run really fast. I caught lots of people here, including my German friend. When we finally reached the bottom and the (official) aid station I was told I was the &apos;prima femmina&apos; female. My Italian isn&apos;t great but I had an inkling this meant first. I didn&apos;t want to get too excited and just smiled and nodded. Will was still hot on my heels but he seemed to have shaken yellow tshirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here it was up and down weaving through small villages on a mix of tarmac and trail between them. The villages were full of cheering locals who&apos;d set up food and water stations, and in one place, a cold shower! The next time I looked behind there was no one in sight and I realised I had pulled ahead of Will. People were still shouting &quot;prima femmina&quot; at me so I kept pushing. There was a fast downhill finish and I had a good sprint in to the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will finished 3 minutes later and we were 19th and 21st respectively. For being the prima femmina I won 2l prosecco, 900g cheese, 500g pasta (to add to the 2kg we&apos;d got at registration), beer, a tshirt, a plant, a backpack, and at the award ceremony they played the national anthem for me on stage. It felt very over the top but I tried my best to look patriotic (and not catch Will&apos;s eye).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole race was on a clear marked trail and well groomed mountain paths (although I did almost take a wrong turn winding through one of the villages). It had the friendly vibe of a low key hill race, but from the award ceremony and crowds felt much bigger. I&apos;d definitely recommend it if you&apos;re looking for a European race. 50 and 103km options also available.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Transvulcania 2019]]></title><link>https://powderach.com/posts/transvulcania-2019</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://powderach.com/posts/transvulcania-2019</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;!-- end --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race morning started with a 3:30 am bus to Fuencaliente. I was too nervous to sleep on the bus, but this was reminiscent of last year&apos;s Fling and it hadn&apos;t mattered then. I ate overnight oats walking down to the lighthouse when we were dropped off. It was cold in the wind so I put on a super light waterproof jacket that I planned to carry with me and made sure I was in a good position for when the start pen opened. I wished I was in the elite pen, but no matter, when the main pen opened I got into a good position not too far back and stood like a sardine for an hour, refusing to give up my spot. The atmosphere was electric. We counted down from ten in Spanish to AC/DC and then set off to cries of &quot;Venga, venga!&quot; The first mile or so was uphill on road, before we turned onto the sand. I&apos;d heeded Bob&apos;s advice about the clouds of dust and sand during the early stage and had a buff to breathe through, but it made little difference and quickly I felt my lungs fill with dust and wanted to cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed Gemma as we got to the first off-road section and we exchanged a &quot;see you later&quot;. I tried to control my breathing and the adrenalin surging through me. I was running. I felt good. As we hit the wide gravel track I chanced a glance behind me. My heart filled with excitement at the sight of the trail of headtorches lighting the darkness all the way back to the sea. This was awesome, and I was part of it! The trail narrowed again to single file before Los Canarios but everyone around me was climbing happily and there was no rushing or pushing. One guy stumbled on a rock and we all helped him up. I realised probably everyone else was as nervous as I was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href=&quot;https://iancorless.org/2018/05/24/episode-156-kelly-wolfe-brittany-peterson-and-alex-kurt/&quot;&gt;podcast after last year&apos;s race&lt;/a&gt; Ian Corless said that coming through Los Canarios is like being in the Tour de France. I&apos;m not sure it lived up to this hype for me, but the crowds were immense and hyper and I can imagine if you were one of the first runners through it would have been wild. There were people lining the streets, many of them still in dressing gowns, dancing to the loud music pumping from the aid station, and volunteers everywhere. I&apos;d barely touched my water so I didn&apos;t stop. From Los Canarios we climbed for the next ten or so miles before a short descent to El Pilar. I got my poles out and settled into a rhythm climbing on the sand, trying not to get too close to anyone to avoid a faceful of dust. The dust was everywhere and made breathing harder. We climbed above the cloud and were rewarded with incredible views of other islands poking through and the sun coming up between them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached El Pilar sooner than I&apos;d expected and feeling great. I topped up my water and continued on, passing lots of people in the aid station. The marathoners were all lining the path and cheering us on as they waited to start their race. The support here was incredible and we were made to feel like superstars. The trail is super runnable from El Pilar and I felt myself flow into a nice rhythm. A woman caught up to me and I slipped in behind her. It was starting to heat up and there wasn&apos;t much shade on the wide track. The next aid station also came sooner than expected. I refilled both bottles but turned down the offer of cold water on my head, which turned out to be a mistake. From here we started to climb again and I began to suffer in the heat. I&apos;d been racing for four and a half hours and had enjoyed it all so far. I&apos;d been feeling great: running smoothly, feeling strong on the climbs and  staying top of my nutrition and hydration. Now it was mid morning and there wasn&apos;t much shade as we climbed out of the forest. Lots of people started to pass me on the climbs, including people I&apos;d overtaken earlier on. The woman I&apos;d been running with disappeared over the distant horizon. I had my poles out to help on the climbs but should have put them away here as I ended up power hiking sections I should have run, or I ran awkwardly with my poles in one hand. Gemma overtook me on one of these undulations, looking very strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the next aid station at Pico de Nieve I again stupidly declined the offer of a cold shower. Ensuring I kept cool wasn&apos;t something I was used to doing and my inexperience showed here. On the climb up to the high point I slowed even more as I was so hot. It felt like I was slowly roasting, and my body was unable to move any faster. But I was mentally holding it together and was drinking lots and eating at planned intervals. I kept putting one foot in front of the other. Relentless forward progress. I finally wobbled into the tent at the Roque de los Muchachos aid station and was immediately taken to sit down by some volunteers. They poured cold water over my head and neck from a saucepan. I wished I could cut all my hair off to keep it off my neck! I ate some fruit and left as soon as I could stand without assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d been looking forward to the descent but didn&apos;t enjoy the first part of it. I still wasn&apos;t feeling great and was being too cautious. I was scared of slipping and picked each step carefully. That&apos;s no way to run down a hill. A few guys flew past me kamikaze style. The marathon runners were catching up now and their race finished down at the beach so they weren&apos;t holding back on the descent! One guy kept passing me and then stopping to stretch, so I&apos;d pass him and we&apos;d do it all again. It was too hot to get annoyed so each time I calmly pulled aside and let him go past. Slowly I started to feel better and flow down the descent more comfortably. Every time there was an easier section I made sure I took a drink. I was on Active Root by now and it tasted amazing. I started to reel people in, including Gemma. She&apos;d bashed her knee and it meant she was having to be cautious downhill. At the aid station at El Time I got doused in cold water again, ate some orange and took some more water. The descent was too fast and furious to think about eating real food outside of the aid stations and I was a little sick of Rice Crispy Squares by this point. Fruit and Clif Shot Bloks were going down ok. I left the aid station as Gemma arrived and told her I&apos;d see her on the final ascent, fully expecting to be caught. I&apos;d been climbing so badly up to Roque I didn&apos;t know how the last climb would go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew past the lady I&apos;d been running with back at El Pilar. I had thought she was long gone. It made me realise how important it is to keep moving, however bad you feel and however slowly you think you&apos;re moving. Everyone has highs and lows in a long race and you should never consider yourself beaten. Thoughts were passing through my mind quickly as my focus had to keep returning to the manic descent. It was breathless and never-ending (it took me over 2 hours!) We dropped from over 2400m to sea level in 17km. My ears popped on the way down! Towards the end we ran down the VK route: super steep road, then steep cobbled switchbacks with a huge drop into the sea on one side. It was awesome and relentless and required all my tired focus. I almost fell about twenty times, stabbing a rock with my foot and just catching myself before smashing face first into the rock. I ran with a massive goofy grin, tongue out, loving it. I felt in my element on the cobbles, quick feet dancing downwards and catching people on every bend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally hit the seafront in Tazacorte at the same time as a marathon runner (who looked much more wiped out than I felt!) I high-fived him and ran through the marathon finish line and into the final aid station amidst huge cheers and a pumping baseline. Another cold shower, more fruit, and I took off onto the beach and the dry stony riverbed. It was more runnable than I&apos;d thought it would be. I ran / walked, hopping over rocks when I could, catching people. It was over quickly and I climbed up to the road and the final switchbacks. I didn&apos;t bother with poles and hiked, hands on knees, drinking frequently and running the flat sections between climbs. I felt like a different person from a few hours before and climbing felt easy again (although I was wary of pushing too hard as I didn&apos;t want to overheat again).  I overtook a handful of guys who looked totally beat. I didn&apos;t know how many switchbacks there were but never let myself think I might be on the last one, or about the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I reached the road into Los Llanos and started to run (it felt super fast but was actually 8:40 mile pace!) I&apos;d walked up and down this road in the heat of the day during the week and I knew how long it could feel, but it felt so good to be moving freely again after so much climbing and descending. I ticked off the things as I ran past them - the Chinese Bingo (not what I thought it was), the stadium, the supermarket, the first arch. People appeared from everywhere to line the street, there were children eating ice creams holding out sticky hands for high-fives and men dashing out of bars for high-fives when they saw me running past. It felt exhilarating (and the celebrations went on all through the evening and into the night, so every finisher was made to feel like a hero!). I slowed and high-fived as many people as I could and crossed the finish line feeling overjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished in 10 hours 26 minutes. 17th female and 101st overall. I finished totally in love with the race, the island and people of La Palma and the whole incredible experience. And I finished feeling proud of how I ran and with lots of ideas for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some thank yous: firstly to Matt for his unwavering confidence in what I can do, even when I don&apos;t believe it myself. To Adrian for the pre-race wisdom, and to Stewart Liesnham and Karl Zeiner for patiently answering all my pre-race questions. And finally to Bob, who didn&apos;t make it to the finish this year (but will be back in 2020) and was my inspiration throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In true ultra style I broke it down. The race in its entirety was too scary. There&apos;s a lot of climbing in the first 10 miles, then some ridge running with lots of spiky bits (both in profile and on the trail itself), then a huge descent to the sea. And for good measure there&apos;s a final 300m climb up to the finish (because finishing back at the sea would be too easy...) I also knew that a fair amount of the climbing would be done on black sand, and that it was likely to be hot. These were all things I could prepare for, with Matt&apos;s help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training had been building since Tenerife. The block up to Glentress went well and my body was coping ok with the higher mileage and harder sessions. The big shift since Glentress is in how I&apos;ve approached the training. It took a weekend away in the lakes with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pyllonultra.com/&quot;&gt;Pyllon team&lt;/a&gt; for me to really commit to the process. Before I was running the reps, but I wasn&apos;t pushing it, I wasn&apos;t giving it everything. I was always holding back, too scared of failing to really try. The weekend away inspired me. Being surrounded by so much positivity and amazing people, hearing so many tales of bravery, success and failure, made me think I could achieve something awesome too. I came away hungry to try. It took a few weeks of tough grinding to feel the change. I had some dreadful sessions and endured some terrible long runs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BvcA-qQgYAa/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&quot;&gt;Thirty something miles on the 3 Lochs Way&lt;/a&gt; that ended in an uphill slog in the wrong direction in horizontal rain and having to be rescued running down the main Loch Lomond road was a particular low point, but I survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally something clicked. I attribute it partly to the change in weather and the clock change. The weekend the clock&apos;s changed I repeated my least favourite session from my last training block. Three reps of Tinto Hill, pushing the final descent and back up to the gate hard after that. I was dreading it. However the conditions were much better than before. There was no ice or snow. It was daylight. It wasn&apos;t 6am on a Tuesday. Also I felt much better this time. I knew I was stronger and I knew I could complete the session. So although I approached it with a sense of foreboding, there was some optimism mixed in. My criteria for this session to be a success was to run all the way to the top at least once. I set off slowly, but running. I ignored the pain in my legs and I ignored the voice inside my head. From halfway up the voice was too loud to ignore so I argued with myself instead and kept running. Eventually I could see the top of the hill at the edge of my vision. I didn&apos;t let myself look at it, and kept running. I ran all the way to the trig-point and threw my arms around it (to the great surprise of the group of walkers already there). The next 2 reps included some walking, but that was ok. Overall I definitely ran more than I walked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my turning point. The following day I ran the Sidlaw Skyline from Dundee to Perth with some friends. There was a huge section in the middle where we trudged uphill though heather, not sure where we were, unable to find a path and going nowhere fast. It took over 7 hours to run 33 miles. It should have been awful, but the combination of good weather, good company an a positive attitude meant it was great fun. The following weekend I raced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.endurancelife.com/exmoor&quot;&gt;32 mile ultra down in Exmoor&lt;/a&gt; (north Devon). I won with a big gap and was 4th overall in a new female course record and inside the old men&apos;s one. More importantly I felt strong throughout and climbed well. A few more weeks of big mileage culminating in a 100 mile week with the Arran trip at the end and I got to my taper feeling great.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d been spending twenty minutes a week in the sauna, which in hindsight isn&apos;t very much, but it was at least some effort to train for the heat... So It had been a good build up but I was worried about the two weeks preceding the race as they involved a lot of travel. I vowed to stay as relaxed as possible. I spent a weekend racing in Ireland with Carnethy, a day at home, a few days in the Lakes for the La Sportiva UK team meetup and then straight out to Madrid for a few days. I tried not to get too stressed by being in a big busy city, and with everything breaking at work. Finally I flew to La Palma and could relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a week on the island before the race. The first few days I braved the scary mountain roads in my tiny hire car driving on the wrong (right) side of the road and hugging the outside of each bend, praying there would be nothing coming the other way. I sought out bits of the course and ran and hiked to familiarise myself with the trail and the heat, and to appreciate the views without the excitement of race day. I watched videos from previous years and thoroughly scared myself. Then I caught up with Bob Allison at the VK and he put my mind at ease about most of my worries. And also gave me some perspective - he has a serious medical condition and was preparing to spend the day chasing cut offs. Yet he was here in La Palma, excited and ready to give it everything he had. I needed to be more like Bob. I received an email from Adrian that inspired me again, with advice to &quot;run the race not the occasion&quot;. I realised I&apos;d got carried away worrying about the spectacle of it. Ultimately it was just a trail race and it was going to be awesome. I&apos;d spent the week wishing I wasn&apos;t tapering and could be out running on the beautiful trails. On race day I would finally get the chance to run without abandon. I was excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(... read part 2 &lt;a href=&quot;./transvulcania-2019&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; - in which I actually write about the race!)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arran Ultraventure]]></title><description><![CDATA[Adventuring at Easter is one of my favourite things. It's a great time of year to be forced to take a long weekend, and this year the weather gods were smiling on us. Given that next time I run the WHW I want to do it in less than 3 days, I wanted a new running adventure this year. The Arran Coastal Way is about 65 miles which seemed a good distance to run over a few days. I was worried it may lack variety but at least we wouldn't have to worry about getting lost - we just had to keep the sea on our right. Even Aisling and I, who had got lost (twice) on an out and back the previous weekend, couldn't go wrong. I gathered some adventure buddies to join the fun and to add some spice we decided to go up the biggest hill on the island on the first day. On Easter Saturday five of us set out early from Brodick and started up Goatfell. I say early, but there were already people coming down the trail as we went up, and it was already quite warm! I regretted wearing a long sleeve top and realised Eoín had probably been right about not needing waterproof trousers. We picked our way up to the summit with some scrambling after leaving the main path by accident. From the top we could see for miles and it was beautiful.]]></description><link>https://powderach.com/posts/arran-ultraventure</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://powderach.com/posts/arran-ultraventure</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

&lt;p&gt;Adventuring at Easter is one of my favourite things. It&apos;s a great time of year to be forced to take a long weekend, and this year the weather gods were smiling on us. Given that next time I run the WHW I want to do it in less than 3 days, I wanted a new running adventure this year. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coastalway.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Arran Coastal Way&lt;/a&gt; is about 65 miles which seemed a good distance to run over a few days. I was worried it may lack variety but at least we wouldn&apos;t have to worry about getting lost - we just had to keep the sea on our right. Even Aisling and I, who had got lost (twice) on an out and back the previous weekend, couldn&apos;t go wrong. I gathered some adventure buddies to join the fun and to add some spice we decided to go up the biggest hill on the island on the first day. On Easter Saturday five of us set out early from Brodick and started up Goatfell. I say early, but there were already people coming down the trail as we went up, and it was already quite warm! I regretted wearing a long sleeve top and realised Eoín had probably been right about not needing waterproof trousers. We picked our way up to the summit with some scrambling after leaving the main path by accident. From the top we could see for miles and it was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We descended down to the coast at Corrie and turned left along the road. From Sannox Will and Ali, who were only joining for the day, turned back into the hills and ran back to Brodick via Glen Rosa. Aisling, Eoín and I continued along the coast. As the others disappeared, the enormity of what we were doing hit us and we ran quietly for a while. Wide gravel track soon became more interesting single track, reminiscent of the Fife Coastal Path. As we approached the north of the island we decided to cut the corner as we&apos;d been advised that the path around the northern edge barely existed. Instead we climbed up a hill and traversed around another, then had a fun run down into Lochranza at the north of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat was taking its toll by now and we were delighted to find a cafe and were revived by coke and cookies. From here we only had another 10 km to go and we were making better progress than we&apos;d realised. From Lochranza the trail wound uphill, away from the road and into the woods. It was an awful almost-path at an awkward camber, full of spiders&apos; webs and low hanging branches. It was impossible to get into a rhythm of running. When we finally dropped down to the road we found we were covered in ticks. Most of them brushed off easily, but we remained paranoid about ticks for the rest of the trip! The road was a relief after this and we settled in to the final few miles to our B and B at Pirnmill. It felt like the end of a triathlon: running in a beautiful location on an empty road. We were running tired but still moving swiftly and smoothly. The sun burned down on us and the road and we were glad to reach the village. Arriving at the B and B after a long 25 mile run was an anticlimax as our host was out and had left the the house open and a note on the door! The sea looked inviting so we climbed across some rocks for a paddle. It was much colder than it looked and we weren&apos;t very brave so only went in up to our knees! After an early dinner at the only restaurant in the village (it was packed!) we watched some dolphins (or possibly porpoises) jumping in pairs in the sea. We retired feeling good about the first day&apos;s run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we ate breakfast whilst watching red squirrels play in front of the house. Aisling had discovered an unwelcome visitor in the form of a tick in her leg and set about removing it before we set off. We started on the road and saw some seals playing near the shore. Then we scrambled and hopped over some rocks before reaching Blackwaterfoot, where we stopped for espressos and scones. Revived by caffeine and sugar we went back onto the rocks. In places rocks had been placed as stepping stones so you had to take small fast steps and maintain momentum to get across them. In others there was no path and you had to pick a line across rocks and sand. It was great fun but slow progress!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coastal route took us past some caves and we explored the King&apos;s Cave (which may have been where Robert the Bruce encountered a spider). We didn&apos;t see any spiders but there were lots of cool carvings in the rock. It was low tide so we had to rejoin the road after this as the coastal path around the south of the island was inaccessible. The road was hilly but the scenery had changed: steep hills and dramatic crags had been replaced by rolling hills and grassy pastures. We learnt that Arran sits on the highland boundary fault like the Scottish mainland. As we traveled south we were reaching the Borders! We soon came across our second stop of the day: a delightful Vèlo cafe. We topped up on cold drinks and suncream before another long stretch on the road. Our final section was up and into a forest. Eoín unexpectedly pushed the pace on the climb. I gave chase but didn&apos;t have much turn of speed on tired legs in the heat! We detoured from the path to check out the best waterfall on Arran (which was better than we&apos;d been imagining). The next detour was more annoying as the path we had planned to take down to the coast was fenced off. This meant a few extra miles on forest track before we dropped down to Whiting Bay. We stopped half a mile from our B and B to enjoy a beer in the sunshine. As soon as we stopped moving I started shivering from the cold wind and ended up sitting in the sun with my jacket and gloves on! We wobbled along to finish for the day after 31 miles (with almost half of that on road).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last morning was very relaxed. Breakfast didn&apos;t start until late and we didn&apos;t have far to go. We started our victory leg with a climb up into the forest and followed a fire road to Lamlash. Already the sun was scorching and the dry trail felt more like the Canaries than Scotland! We raced down to Lamlash, enjoying the descent and followed the coastal path back to Brodick. The technical rocky path here was a nice end to the trail, and we finished with delicious Arran ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great weekend and we were truly blessed by hot weather and sunshine. I hadn&apos;t expected it to be warm weather training but I&apos;m classing it as that! Running around an island is a satisfying achievement and any trip that includes a ferry journey is an adventure in my eyes. I&apos;m already planning my return for a weekend to spend a day cycling around the island and a day exploring the ridges behind Goatfell.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
