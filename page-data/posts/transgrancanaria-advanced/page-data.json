Get familiar with building and collapsing them and getting them in and out of my pack.</li>\n<li>Research the route and race profile in plenty of time. A week on holiday with an active toddler is not the time to do this! I feel more relaxed when I know what to expect on the route, and not have to rely solely on the race profile printed on my race number! </li>\n<li>Do some longer climbs and descents in training. I did most of my training in the Pentland Hills, and the highest hill, Scald Law, is only 579m. I did a lot of reps so got plenty of elevation, but it meant some of the climbs in the race felt never-ending. I'd like this to be less of a surprise to my body on race day! This should be easier to do as the weather improves and it's easier to get to bigger hills.</li>\n<li>Run faster on the descents! I’m really pleased with how I descended in this race as it’s taken a while to build my descending confidence back up postpartum. But now I feel strong downhill again so it’s time to push a bit outside my comfort zone!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8b9fcc33a50343a0f92528c9ea78d5b2/e44b7/medal.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 133.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Showing off my finisher medal\"\n        title=\"Showing off my finisher medal\"\n        src=\"/static/8b9fcc33a50343a0f92528c9ea78d5b2/4b190/medal.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8b9fcc33a50343a0f92528c9ea78d5b2/e07e9/medal.jpg 200w,\n/static/8b9fcc33a50343a0f92528c9ea78d5b2/066f9/medal.jpg 400w,\n/static/8b9fcc33a50343a0f92528c9ea78d5b2/4b190/medal.jpg 800w,\n/static/8b9fcc33a50343a0f92528c9ea78d5b2/e5166/medal.jpg 1200w,\n/static/8b9fcc33a50343a0f92528c9ea78d5b2/b17f8/medal.jpg 1600w,\n/static/8b9fcc33a50343a0f92528c9ea78d5b2/e44b7/medal.jpg 3888w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2024","path":"/posts/transgrancanaria-advanced","title":"Transgrancanaria Advanced","imageShare":{"publicURL":"/static/5da92fc9e3739314e50967602daeca94/rocks.jpeg"}}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"]}
