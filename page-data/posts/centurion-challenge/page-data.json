I still hadn't worked out if I was going to run. Travelling to the south of England from Scotland felt like it might be irresponsible.\nThe organisers - <a href=\"https://www.centurionrunning.com/\">Centurion Running</a> instead organised a <a href=\"https://www.centurionrunning.com/reports/2020/2020-one-community-ii-race-report\">virtual challenge</a> for the week leading up to the race.\nI signed up to run 100 miles in the week.</p>\n<p>I've run 100 mile weeks before when peak ultra training, but I'm definitely not in that shape at the moment! Here's how it went... </p>\n<!-- end -->\n<h3>Monday</h3>\n<p>To get the week off to a good start I did my first run before work. Road shoes on, along the canal. It was cold and harder than I expected.\nI was full of self-doubt.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>When did I last run on the road? Am I going too fast? When did I last wear road shoes? Should I slow down? I should slow down...</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By the time I got home my right calf was sore.</p>\n<p>After work I set out for another 4 miles on the road.\nIt was raining and windy, but the first mile was downhill with the wind behind me.\nIt should have felt easy.\nIt didn't. When I turned into the wind I was already cursing. I slowly crawled to the top of the hill.\nAnother runner overtook me as I neared the top. He looked super smooth. The hill wasn't bothering him.\nI sped up as I turned for the final downhill, more to prove to myself that I could than anything else.\nBut now on the opposite side of the road from the other runner I sped up until I drew level with him and suddenly felt silly and embarassed.</p>\n<p>I was not sure I could do this.</p>\n<p>10/100</p>\n<h3>Tuesday</h3>\n<p>I ignored my alarm. There would be no run before work.\nI had back-to-back meetings all morning and by the time I finally left for a run at lunch time I was felt panicky.\nI was taking on too much.\nThis week I needed to do quarterly reviews for my team, organise an openspace for next week and work through a team reshuffle.\nI was only working 3 days in a desperate final bid to use up my holiday for the year (totally my fault and terrible planning!)</p>\n<p>Why was I also trying to run 100 miles this week?</p>\n<p>I set out feeling angry and frustrated - at work, at myself, at the world. I forgot to start my watch.\nI could feel myself tearing up but I fought back the tears.\nI focused on breathing and putting one foot in front of the other. </p>\n<p>I ran along the Water of Leith trail in light trail shoes.\nBy mile 3 I was running through fields at the edge of the Pentlands and next to some reservoirs.\nI had the trails to myself and I felt calm again.\nIt was just running. I could do this, one run at a time.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px;
