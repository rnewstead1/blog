They help us to determine what is important to us. Values describe the personal qualities we choose to embody to guide our actions; the sort of person we want to be; the manner in which we treat ourselves and others, and our interaction with the world around us. They provide the general guidelines for conduct.</p>\n<p>When aligning with our values we tend to feel more energetic, positive, and live with clarity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Activity</h2>\n<p>Most people created their own <a href=\"https://miro.com/\">Miro</a> board from a template I'd created.\nBut you don't need a template or Miro - you just need 10 post-it notes.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c63dcc63438cdef21fd166c24b50e393/c6d67/post-its.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.333333333333336%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Post-its\"\n        title=\"Post-its\"\n        src=\"/static/c63dcc63438cdef21fd166c24b50e393/0a47e/post-its.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c63dcc63438cdef21fd166c24b50e393/8a4e8/post-its.png 150w,\n/static/c63dcc63438cdef21fd166c24b50e393/5a46d/post-its.png 300w,\n/static/c63dcc63438cdef21fd166c24b50e393/0a47e/post-its.png 600w,\n/static/c63dcc63438cdef21fd166c24b50e393/c6d67/post-its.png 734w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start by writing down 10 values that are important to you, one on each post-it note.\nWe used this list for ideas, but you can pick values that are not on there too - as long as they're important to you.\nThere is no right or wrong answer. It's ok for this first part to take a while - we took 5 minutes and that felt a little rushed.\nBy the end of the time you should feel comfortable that once you have 10 values in your list, they are all important to you.</li>\n<li>Next, we refine the values. 10 is a lot. You have 30 seconds. Discard the 3 <em>least</em> important to you from the values you wrote down.</li>\n<li>Now you have 20 seconds to discard 2 more.</li>\n<li>For the last time - 20 seconds, discard 2 more. This is meant to be hard!</li>\n<li>You now have your 3 core values. You might want to reword them or better define what they mean to you, add notes about why you chose them. Maybe you discarded something because you decided it was encompassed by one of your remaining values - add that note.\nMaybe you feel super uncomfortable about one of your last discards and want to bring that back in - that's ok. Having 3 - 5 core values is best.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ask the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What do I feel about the values I ended up with?</li>\n<li>Were they as expected or did they surprise me?</li>\n<li>How do these values show themselves in my everyday life?</li>\n<li>What actions do I already take to live by them?</li>\n<li>What actions would I like to take to live by them?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's what I came up with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Honesty</li>\n<li>Freedom</li>\n<li>Empathy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For me personally doing this exercise was powerful as it made me realise that there were some things going on in my life that directly conflicted with my personal values.\nWhen I realised this it intuitively made sense - I'd been feeeling a deep sense of discomfort and couldn't put my finger on why.\nHaving a clear set of values helped me better articulate what I was feeling, and then change the situation.\nSince doing this exercise I've left a job that had become bad for me.\nI've started somewhere new where I feel aligned with the values of my team and company.</p>\n<p>Finally, your values are not static and are likely to change over time. They should be memorable and things that you feel strongly about at your core.</p>\n<p>Somehow attach the miro template / pdf\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/search?q=values\">https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/search?q=values</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 07, 2021","path":"/posts/values-workshop","title":"Values workshop"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
