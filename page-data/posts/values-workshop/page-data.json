They help us to determine what is important to us. Values describe the personal qualities we choose to embody to guide our actions; the sort of person we want to be; the manner in which we treat ourselves and others, and our interaction with the world around us. They provide the general guidelines for conduct.</p>\n<p>When aligning with our values we tend to feel more energetic, positive, and live with clarity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Activity</h2>\n<p>Most people created their own <a href=\"https://miro.com/\">Miro</a> board from a template I'd created.\nBut you don't need a template or Miro - you just need 10 post-it notes.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 734px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/6d442029e9aed88c10937be23c7df959/c6d67/post-its.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Post-its\"\n        title=\"Post-its\"\n        src=\"/static/6d442029e9aed88c10937be23c7df959/c6d67/post-its.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6d442029e9aed88c10937be23c7df959/772e8/post-its.png 200w,\n/static/6d442029e9aed88c10937be23c7df959/e17e5/post-its.png 400w,\n/static/6d442029e9aed88c10937be23c7df959/c6d67/post-its.png 734w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start by writing down 10 values that are important to you, one on each post-it note.</strong>\nYou can look at a <a href=\"https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-core-values.html\">list of examples</a> for ideas if it helps.\nBut don't let the list restrict you!\nThere is no right or wrong answer.\nEach value should be important to <em>you</em>.\nIt's ok for this first part to take a while.\nWe only spent 5 minutes on this and some people felt a little rushed.\nThe timings for the next stages are strict, so take some extra time here to ensure everyone feels comfortable with their 10 values.</li>\n<li><strong>Next refine the values.</strong>\nYou have 30 seconds to discard the 3 <em>least</em> important values of those you wrote down.</li>\n<li><strong>Refine again.</strong>\nNow you have 20 seconds to discard 2 more.</li>\n<li><strong>And again.</strong>\nFor the last time, take 20 seconds to discard 2 more. This is meant to be hard!</li>\n<li><strong>The values remaining are your 3 core values.</strong>\nYou might want to reword them or better define what they mean to you, and add notes about why you chose them.\nMaybe you discarded something because it was encompassed by one of your remaining values: is there a word or phrase that would better express both?\nIf you feel super uncomfortable about one of your last discards it's ok to bring it back in.\nHaving 3 - 5 core values is best. More than this would be too many to try and live by. </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>Now you have your values, discuss the following questions as a group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What do I feel about the values I ended up with?</li>\n<li>Were they as expected or did they surprise me?</li>\n<li>How do these values show themselves in my everyday life?</li>\n<li>What actions do I already take to live by them?</li>\n<li>What actions would I like to take to live by them?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Finish up</h2>\n<p>Your values are not static and are likely to change over time.\nThey should be memorable and things that you feel strongly about at your core.</p>\n<p>I found this exercise very powerful.\nI ended up with the following values:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/72a669c8a2c61381cf5cdc6205cbf09c/d9199/my-values.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.00000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"My values - honesty, empathy, freedom\"\n        title=\"My values - honesty, empathy, freedom\"\n        src=\"/static/72a669c8a2c61381cf5cdc6205cbf09c/5a190/my-values.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/72a669c8a2c61381cf5cdc6205cbf09c/772e8/my-values.png 200w,\n/static/72a669c8a2c61381cf5cdc6205cbf09c/e17e5/my-values.png 400w,\n/static/72a669c8a2c61381cf5cdc6205cbf09c/5a190/my-values.png 800w,\n/static/72a669c8a2c61381cf5cdc6205cbf09c/d9199/my-values.png 960w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Realising these were the values most important to me helped me identify things in my life that were in direct conflict with these values.\nBefore I'd been feeling a deep sense of discomfort and couldn't put my finger on why.\nHaving a clear set of values helped me better articulate what I was feeling, and then change the situation.\nSince doing this exercise I've left a job that had become bad for me.\nI've started somewhere new where I feel aligned with the values of my team and company.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/Values%20workshop.pdf\">Instructions as pdf</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 07, 2021","path":"/posts/values-workshop","title":"Values workshop"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
