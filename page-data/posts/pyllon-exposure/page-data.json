However, you won’t know exactly what distance you have to run. Each hour of the event, we will reveal how many miles you will have to cover that hour. It’s then up to you to choose how fast you want to run - run hard and gain some rest time before the next hourly exposure? Pace it more carefully knowing that you’ll have to survive another 5, 10, or 20 hours?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Will signed up for 6 hours and I signed up for 12.</p>\n<!-- end -->\n<div

lockdown in Scotland ended early which meant we could have driven somewhere new and exciting to run.\nBut after being in one place for the last seven months we favoured comfort and familiarity and the ease of returning home every hour.\nWe didn't consider that this would make it much harder to get back out later in the day!</p>\n<p>I spent Friday baking and preparing snacks: rice cakes and polenta cakes from <a href=\"https://feedzonecookbook.com/portables/\">Feed Zone Portables</a>, sweet potato cookies from <a href=\"https://runfasteatslow.com/pages/books\">Run Fast Eat Slow</a>, savoury muffins and sweet muffins from the <a href=\"https://www.steampunkcoffee.co.uk/collections/gift-ideas-1/products/recipes-for-happiness-preorder\">Steam Punk recipe book</a>, <a href=\"http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/24488/chilli-cheese-flapjacks.aspx\">cheese flapjacks</a>.\nA scallion pancake that was a disaster - it was basically just flour and water that I didn't roll thin enough.\nWe threw the undercooked dough straight in the bin!\nI planned loops of different distances from the house.\nIn my head it was going to be a big snack party, with some running in between.\nDuring the week I test-ran a few of my loops and tried to imagine going back out to do another after a short rest.\nI couldn't visualise it.\nI realised it was going to be quite a challenge!</p>\n<p>We started at 8am with <strong>5 miles</strong>.\nTo make the most of the early hour we both ran along the canal.\nI ran in towards town, knowing it would be too busy to do so later.\nWill ran in the opposite direction - we didn't want to run together early on as we were running quite different races!\nI knew I'd get carried away and try to keep up with him, which would likely bite me later in the day.\nThe sun was already shining and there were a few dog walkers and rowers about, all smiling at each other as we greeted the day.\nThere was a cold breeze from the east, making my first few miles a push into a headwind.\nBut it's hard to run slowly on the canal, especially when you're feeling fresh after an easy week!\nWill beat me home by a few minutes and we took on some water while we waited for our next text.</p>\n<p><strong>6 miles</strong>.</p>\n<p>We set off together again to do a loop along the Water of Leith and Woodhall Road.\nWill went up West Mill road for a clockwise loop while I stayed on the Water of Leith to go anti-clockwise.\nI crossed Gintas coming under the bypass.\nI'd talked him into the 6 hour Exposure and he'd planned a 6 hour adventure round Edinburgh, seeing where he would end up at the end of each Exposure!\nI crossed Will as I climbed the steps to Blinkbonny.\nAfter an uphill start I enjoyed the rolling downhill miles towards home and arrived home shortly after Will again.\nWe were both feeling good and had espressos to celebrate!</p>\n<p>Exposure 3 was <strong>5 miles</strong>.\nFor this one we both put podcasts on and ran towards Craiglockhart.\nI caught up with Will at the traffic lights, dodging cars to cross the road.\nThe route was hilly: we ran up and around the side of Wester Craiglockhart hill and it was hard work to maintain a good pace.\nThis was a small dillema for a virtual race from home.\nMost of the interesting runs from our house are hilly, but that wasn't practical for when we were trying to get back well inside an hour.\nIt meant we spent a lot more time running on tarmac than usual!\nThis loop came in slightly under distance as we approached our road, so we split up to lap up and down nearby streets.</p>\n<p>Next up was another <strong>6 miles</strong>.\nThis time Will and I set off in opposite directions from each other.\nI went through Hailes Quarry Park, then followed the cycle path through Stenhouse to the Jenners factory and joined the Water of Leith.\nI sidestepped through the crowds of people playing in the sunshine in Saughton skate park and dashed across Gorgie Road.\nThis time I beat Will back.</p>\n<p>Exposure 5 was only <strong>4 miles</strong> and I ran a short loop on the Water of Leith, Woodhall Road and Lanark Road.\nRunning back down Lanark Road I found it hard to control my speed down the hill and clocked my only sub-7 minute mile for the 12 hours!\nWill had done a loop through Colinton and I caught up with him on the downhill as we turned for home.\nWe had a decent rest before the next Exposure, but were both feeling tired from the heat and from running fast.\nI tried a red lentil rice cake but it was disappointingly bland and the texture was gloopy.\nI won't make those again!\nWe agreed that this was a very hard challenge.\nI was jealous that Will had only one Exposure left.\nWhy had I signed up for 12 hours?</p>\n<p>Exposure 6 was <strong>5 miles</strong>.\nWe were both struggling so set off together for an easy out and back on the Water of Leith.\nThe trail is sheltered from the wind.\nThe way out is uphill but that means an easier run back when you're more tired (at least this is what I always tell myself).\nIt gets super busy at the weekend with families and dogs but in most places the trail is wide enough to hop to the side and overtake.\nI'd assumed I'd get left behind but Will soon dropped behind me.\nBy the Colinton tunnel I couldn't see him at all.\nI could hear the echo of his footsteps slapping the tarmac through the tunnel.\nHis steps sounded tired!\nThe half mile before the turnaround felt like a lot of effort.\nI followed the diversion onto the main road and continued along there until it was time to turn, sidestepping people and parked cars.\nLuckily I was motivated by the thought of the downhill.\nIt's barely noticeable to look at but when I run intervals here I run substantially faster on the way back because the slight gradient makes me feel like I'm flying!\nComing back through the tunnel I spotted a guy running towards me wearing an Exposure race bib, but there was no time to say hello or even wave.\nAs usual the tunnel was full of people standing around reading and photographing the mural, unaware of anyone passing through.\nLuckily I've danced through this tunnel enough times in the last year to barely break stride.\nThe last mile was definitely a slog and the uphill to home felt like climbing a mountain.\nWill returned a good 10 minutes later looking slightly shell-shocked.\nIt had been a long shuffle for him, but he'd just run the furthest he'd ever run in a day!</p>\n<div class=\"inline-image-right-sm\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"

was feeling slightly broken and not sure if I could continue.\nLuckily the best text message came through with the mileage for Exposure 7 - <strong>1 mile</strong>!</p>\n<p><em>I could run 1 mile.</em></p>\n<p>Revived by that positive thought I headed out to the canal and managed to run a mile in under 8 minutes.\nNow I needed to recover before what was sure to be a big next Exposure!\nI ate a bagel and a cheese flapjack and lay on the floor with my legs up against the wall.\nMy legs were twitchy.\nMy back was chafed and my toes were blistered.\nI felt like a wreck and there were still five Exposures left!\nMy heart was racing so I focused on slowing down my breathing, closing my eyes, and trying to relax.\nWith 15 minutes to go I got up and changed my clothes and shoes, and had another espresso while I waited for the next text to come through.</p>\n<p><strong>5 miles</strong>.</p>\n<p>Will told me I could do it and suggested I run out and back along Lanark Road.\nI had no better ideas, and hadn't done that yet, so I agreed.\nThe first mile to the traffic lights is a slow and painful uphill slog on the best of days.\nToday at least the wind was on my side.\nAfter the traffic lights I settled into the run and felt much better by the turnaround.\nI took the final downhill mile a lot slower than usual but still finished in a respectable time.\nThe afternoon was roasting and I changed my top again and had a rehydration sachet, then put my legs up again for another ten minutes.</p>\n<p>Exposure 9 was <strong>3 miles</strong>.\nI headed out feeling ok and ran along the canal to Hailes Quarry Park for a few loops.\nAfter the first two miles I suddenly felt terrible and slowed down to a trot.\nI made it back home but didn't feel good at all.\nI was shivering despite the heat and put a down jacket on as soon as I got through the door.\nI tried eating a polenta cake (it tasted much better than the rice cake, but it was not what I wanted at this point).\nWill gave me some mini cheddars which tasted like the most amazing food ever!\nThen the text I had been dreading came through: the next Exposure was <strong>6 miles</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>I can't do it</em>, I told Will.</p>\n<p>He told me I had to try.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Go. Shuffle. You got this.</em></strong></p>\n<p>So I shuffled out and down to the Water of Leith, planning to run the revers of the 6 mile loop I'd run on Exposure 2.\nThis meant the climb came shortly after the first mile.\nI made a pitiful attempt to run it but soon resorted to a march.\nLuckily the climb is short but steep, so running up it isn't much quicker than walking.\nHowever I was finding walking a bit of a challenge too.\nI had to grab hold of a tree and use it to haul myself up the hill.\nLast time I had to grab hold of that particular tree was when I crashed into it on my snowboard earlier this year.\nAt least this time it was helpful!\nI managed to start running again at the top.\nI shuffled through Campbell Park, onto Woodhall Road and through to Blinkbonny.\nAs I rejoined the road I saw it climbing up and away from me and couldn't face another climb, so turned downhill instead!\nI shuffled back along the Water of Leith to the canal junction, and had to walk the uphill to the bridge over Lanark Road.\nThen I had to walk again up Arnott Gardens.\nI tried to make myself feel better by reminding myself that I have to push my single speed up this road when it's windy!\nUnfortunately I still had another half mile to run so I had a slow plod up and down the road till my watch finally beeped for 6 miles.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-image-left\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative;
