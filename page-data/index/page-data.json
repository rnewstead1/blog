Afterwards I’ve been doing a longer run / hike up into the hills for a few hours with a lunch stop up a hill. I’ve enjoyed spending some time in the hills, but recently this has become too tiring and I've struggled for energy the following day. So for the last few weeks I’ve swapped the longer run for a cruise in the hills on my mountain bike instead.</li>\n<li>Tuesday: <a href=\"https://www.jillyreidphysio.co.uk/pilates\">online pregnancy pilates</a> and an easy evening run (usually 5-6km) with our local mum’s running club. I struggle to keep up with the main group now but there are usually some newer runners that I can hang with.</li>\n<li>Wednesday: rest</li>\n<li>Thursday: 30 min run followed by 20 mins of core and strength work</li>\n<li>Friday: Bump Club with an 8km cycle to and from the class with Jane on the bike (it's uphill on the way home so this is hard work)!</li>\n<li>Weekend: run for about an hour run one day, and rest the other</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px;

for too long.\nWhen that's happened I felt ok at the time, but was extra tired and had some pelvic floor weakness the next day.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-image-left\">\n    <span

set me up to recover well postpartum last time.\nIt’s also an element of training I often neglect when I’m focused on a race so it’s fun to invest the time in doing it while I’m running less!\nI particularly like doing classes that are specifically designed for pregnant women, or where there are always safe variations given.\nFor example, at Bump Club I've switched from doing core work on my back to doing it on my hands and knees.\nI get to work the same muscles but in a safe and more comfortable way, and Sarah the instructor always checks on my form and that different exercises feel ok.\nThe pregnancy pilates classes are pre-recorded but physio Jilly always gives different modifications for each exercise.\n<br><br>\n<p>Although the research on exercise in pregnancy has increased a lot during the last ten years there are still huge gaps.\nMost of the existing research is focused on how exercising affects the fetus rather than how it affects the mother.\nIt’s difficult to get studies through ethics committees and also to find participants when there is so much that's still unknown.\nNo one wants to approve, or volunteer for, a study that might harm a baby!\nHowever, as more women are staying active (and at high levels) during pregnancy, hopefully this means that more research will follow.\nI’ve been listening to the <a href=\"https://carriepagliano.com/active-mom-podcast/\">Active Mom Podcast</a> with Dr Carrie Pagliano which is great for keeping up with the latest research.\nShe interviews researchers and health professionals who are leading on this, as well as interviewing athletes about their stories.</p>\n<p>One of the main challenges I’ve found when training during pregnancy is feeling like I've lost my athletic identity.\nI struggle to feel like an athlete when I'm not training with progression or purpose.\nThis feeling is easier to handle second time round as I have the experience and knowledge of having been here before and got back to running at a high level.\nI frequently remind myself that pregnancy is just a short time in the context of life!\nI also tell myself that anything I can do now (walking, core work, strength training) should make getting back to exercise easier, plus it helps me feel more like myself!</p>\n<p>I do find it hard to accept the physical loss of control of my body.\nAs an athlete I’m used to having fine-grained control of my body through diet and training.\nIn pregnancy I can’t control the way it changes and my growing belly is a constant reminder of this.\nEverything feels harder as I’m carrying more weight and my heart and lungs are being squished by the baby.\nI get out of breath very easily!\nHowever one advantage of being an athlete is that I’m good at listening to my body, and trusting that it knows what it's doing.\nAccepting that I can't control everything is also good practice for motherhood!</p>\n<p>I’ve been to see a women's health physio during my pregnancy (something I also did last time).\nThis time it was mainly for reassurance and advice around pelvic floor training.\nI found that my pelvic floor was already weaker at the start of my pregnancy than it was last time, so I’ve had to do more work on this.\nMy bump grew bigger earlier than last time, which then means the increased weight pushing down on my pelvic floor will be for longer.\nThis is definitely something I’m conscious of when running, especially on downhills, and I walk sections if I feel uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>I am more confident in what I’m doing this time, even though it’s a higher volume than last pregnancy.\nThat confidence comes from having gone through it before, but also from learning from others and what they have done.\nRecently I particularly enjoyed listening to Leah Yingling on the <a href=\"https://sandyboyproductions.com/the-trail-network/\">Trail Network Podcast</a> (episode 55) talk about doing a 50km race when 5 months pregnant and how it was much harder than she had expected!\nI'm sure my training volume will decrease as I get closer to full term, but I'll certainly try to stay as active as possible to the end.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto;
