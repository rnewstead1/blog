I remember a winter session of military fitness a long time ago, running with a bib round my waist and someone using it to pull me back. I remember landing on my left foot and twisting, and sharp pain in my knee. It disrupted my training for the 2014 London marathon. I stopped running and went to see a physio. I was diagnosed with tight hips and weak glutes. Standard runner issues. Too much running, not enough strength work. I diligently did the physio exercises and swapped running for cycling. It recovered in time for me to resume training and run the marathon. But the underlying issue never fully went away and it's niggled off and on ever since. I accepted that I had a dodgy left knee and would avoid doing things to fully bend it - squat thrusts and sitting cross-legged in a certain way. It was sometimes a bit sore but crucially it didn't stop me running.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Feb 2020","path":"/posts/knees","title":"Knees"}}},{"node":{"id":"0a7f3146-17d1-5e7d-9334-82c7cd87e69e","excerpt":"<p>Between Christmas and New year I <em>almost</em> recced the <a href=\"https://www.centurionrunning.com/races/north-downs-way-50-2020\">North Downs Way 50</a>. It was a half plan that sort of fitted in with the holidays. We were down south anyway visiting my folks and trains were running. I booked a Travelodge in Dorking for the evening of Friday 27th December. After Lanzarote my knee was more sore than I wanted to admit but I hoped it would hold out. It felt much better after an emergency massage from <a href=\"https://www.equilibry.co.uk/\">Grant</a>, and he taped my knee up for good measure. We bailed on the annual Boxing Day race due to bad weather and I ran alone instead, testing the knee. It didn't hurt on every step and there were moments where I forgot about the pain. I clung to these.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/938d122ec1512ba5e7e67d268b2f0265/c08c5/ndw.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Start of the route\"\n        title=\"Start of the route\"\n        src=\"/static/938d122ec1512ba5e7e67d268b2f0265/c08c5/ndw.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/938d122ec1512ba5e7e67d268b2f0265/e07e9/ndw.jpg 200w,\n/static/938d122ec1512ba5e7e67d268b2f0265/066f9/ndw.jpg 400w,\n/static/938d122ec1512ba5e7e67d268b2f0265/c08c5/ndw.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Jan 2020","path":"/posts/recceing-the-north-downs-way","title":"Recceing the North Downs Way"}}},{"node":{"id":"e00b181d-01b6-52d1-8bcf-58aa94334a69","excerpt":"<p>To continue my running tour of the Canary Islands I went to Lanzarote the week before Christmas.

After a month of little running after Lavaredo I built back up slowly with the help of some great physio sessions with Kenny at <a href=\"https://spaceclinics.co.uk/\">Space Clinics</a>. Matt carefully wrote me a training plan which we tweaked weekly depending on how my knee was recovering. At the beginning we didn't know if I'd be able to complete the training. But my knee slowly improved and I arrived in France ready to run the <a href=\"https://www.festivaldestempliers.com/courses/templiers/\">Grand Trail des Templiers</a> feeling fit and confident. I'd recce'd the route in August and was excited to run on the trails there.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Oct 2019","path":"/posts/a-plan-that-didnt-come-together","title":"A plan that didn't come together"}}},{"node":{"id":"0f9e5592-16cc-5359-941a-534d3f528703","excerpt":"<p>The Highland 200 was a dream of Elaine's, inspired by the <a href=\"http://www.highlandtrail.net/\">Highland 550</a> mountain bike route.

The original plan was for three of us to run and two others to support with driving, but of course it didn't work out quite like that.
