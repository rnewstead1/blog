I remember a winter session of military fitness a long time ago, running with a bib round my waist and someone using it to pull me back. I remember landing on my left foot and twisting, and sharp pain in my knee. It disrupted my training for the 2014 London marathon. I stopped running and went to see a physio. I was diagnosed with tight hips and weak glutes. Standard runner issues. Too much running, not enough strength work. I diligently did the physio exercises and swapped running for cycling. It recovered in time for me to resume training and run the marathon. But the underlying issue never fully went away and it's niggled off and on ever since. I accepted that I had a dodgy left knee and would avoid doing things to fully bend it - squat thrusts and sitting cross-legged in a certain way. It was sometimes a bit sore but crucially it didn't stop me running.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Feb 2020","path":"/posts/knees","title":"Knees"}}},{"node":{"id":"0a7f3146-17d1-5e7d-9334-82c7cd87e69e","excerpt":"<p>Between Christmas and New year I <em>almost</em> recced the <a href=\"https://www.centurionrunning.com/races/north-downs-way-50-2020\">North Downs Way 50</a>.

As we lined up on the start line we realised we'd both forgotten to put suncream on. It was still early but the sun was already out and the forecast was for temperatures in the 30s. We decided we'd have to run fast and finish before the midday rays could burn us. Other than that, we were ready. I had poles and a visor in a bid to fit in with the Europeans and I was pretty sure it was working. There was loud dramatic music playing and we counted down in Italian to start the race, amidst cheers from the crowd. Immediately after the starting tape there was a 90 degree right hand turn. This seemed like bad planning but luckily there wasn't too much jostling for position and Will and I settled in next to each other on the run out of town. We turned onto a trail for the first small climb and ran up it easily together. One guy in front immediately started to hike with his poles as he hit the incline. He was passed very quickly.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Jun 2019","path":"/posts/dolomiti-extreme-trail","title":"Dolomiti Extreme Trail"}}},{"node":{"id":"37e17774-2735-5131-8ab0-5f2b9f62baf7","excerpt":"<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"800\"\n              height=\"400\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B69IU-893zE\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              allowfullscreen\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"May 2019","path":"/posts/transvulcania-2019","title":"Transvulcania 2019"}}},{"node":{"id":"f66ca89e-46b4-5801-894b-ce680552b021","excerpt":"<div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n    <i>\n    You gotta have faith.<br/>\n    You gotta trust the training.<br/>\n    (And do the training).\n    </i>\n</div>\n<p>I'd wanted to run this race since the first time I opened <a href=\"https://iancorless.org/runningbeyondbook/\">Ian Corless' Running Beyond book</a>. Transvulcania is the first entry. The jagged volcanic ridges scared and inspired me in equal measure. After failing to convince Will that we should honeymoon on La Palma (it is a pain to get to) I put it out of my mind for a few years. But 2019 is the year of doing big scary races abroad. Transvulcania was first on the list. Running in Tenerife over Christmas has both given me confidence that it was possible, and scared me further. The Blue Trail route goes up higher, so neither the climb or the descent would be as long at Transvulcania, but over Christmas we'd split the route over multiple days. It was going to feel similar to if we'd run the first two days in one. I couldn't fathom this.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"May 2019","path":"/posts/transvulcania-2019-the-build-up","title":"Transvulcania 2019 - The build up"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
