After many hours of waiting, and a lot of money, the RAC man fixed our van and we got back on the road.

I remember a winter session of military fitness a long time ago, running with a bib round my waist and someone using it to pull me back. I remember landing on my left foot and twisting, and sharp pain in my knee. It disrupted my training for the 2014 London marathon. I stopped running and went to see a physio. I was diagnosed with tight hips and weak glutes. Standard runner issues. Too much running, not enough strength work. I diligently did the physio exercises and swapped running for cycling. It recovered in time for me to resume training and run the marathon. But the underlying issue never fully went away and it's niggled off and on ever since. I accepted that I had a dodgy left knee and would avoid doing things to fully bend it - squat thrusts and sitting cross-legged in a certain way. It was sometimes a bit sore but crucially it didn't stop me running.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Feb 2020","path":"/posts/knees","title":"Knees","tags":null}}},{"node":{"id":"086cfc88-7954-5e69-9f7a-7ab69d868ccd","excerpt":"<p>Between Christmas and New year I <em>almost</em> recced the <a href=\"https://www.centurionrunning.com/races/north-downs-way-50-2020\">North Downs Way 50</a>.

We decided we'd have to run fast and finish before the midday rays could burn us. Other than that, we were ready. I had poles and a visor in a bid to fit in with the Europeans and I was pretty sure it was working. There was loud dramatic music playing and we counted down in Italian to start the race, amidst cheers from the crowd. Immediately after the starting tape there was a 90 degree right hand turn. This seemed like bad planning but luckily there wasn't too much jostling for position and Will and I settled in next to each other on the run out of town. We turned onto a trail for the first small climb and ran up it easily together. One guy in front immediately started to hike with his poles as he hit the incline. He was passed very quickly.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Jun 2019","path":"/posts/dolomiti-extreme-trail","title":"Dolomiti Extreme Trail","tags":null}}},{"node":{"id":"44d047de-4e41-54ce-95b9-c7111f6c0476","excerpt":"<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"800\"\n              height=\"400\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B69IU-893zE\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              allowfullscreen\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"May 2019","path":"/posts/transvulcania-2019","title":"Transvulcania 2019","tags":null}}},{"node":{"id":"15a57b00-154a-5092-8c47-cdac35fbf858","excerpt":"<div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n    <i>\n    You gotta have faith.<br/>\n    You gotta trust the training.<br/>\n    (And do the training).\n    </i>\n</div>\n<p>I'd wanted to run this race since the first time I opened <a href=\"https://iancorless.org/runningbeyondbook/\">Ian Corless' Running Beyond book</a>. Transvulcania is the first entry. The jagged volcanic ridges scared and inspired me in equal measure. After failing to convince Will that we should honeymoon on La Palma (it is a pain to get to) I put it out of my mind for a few years. But 2019 is the year of doing big scary races abroad. Transvulcania was first on the list. Running in Tenerife over Christmas has both given me confidence that it was possible, and scared me further. The Blue Trail route goes up higher, so neither the climb or the descent would be as long at Transvulcania, but over Christmas we'd split the route over multiple days. It was going to feel similar to if we'd run the first two days in one. I couldn't fathom this.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"May 2019","path":"/posts/transvulcania-2019-the-build-up","title":"Transvulcania 2019 - The build up","tags":null}}},{"node":{"id":"736ccc54-293c-5d6f-8102-f859eb0815a2","excerpt":"<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b59de50ba55dc47dc680194d31771fe0/c54d6/first-sighting.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"First sighting\"\n        title=\"First sighting\"\n        src=\"/static/b59de50ba55dc47dc680194d31771fe0/4b190/first-sighting.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b59de50ba55dc47dc680194d31771fe0/e07e9/first-sighting.jpg 200w,\n/static/b59de50ba55dc47dc680194d31771fe0/066f9/first-sighting.jpg 400w,\n/static/b59de50ba55dc47dc680194d31771fe0/4b190/first-sighting.jpg 800w,\n/static/b59de50ba55dc47dc680194d31771fe0/e5166/first-sighting.jpg 1200w,\n/static/b59de50ba55dc47dc680194d31771fe0/b17f8/first-sighting.jpg 1600w,\n/static/b59de50ba55dc47dc680194d31771fe0/c54d6/first-sighting.jpg 4128w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Adventuring at Easter is one of my favourite things. It's a great time of year to be forced to take a long weekend, and this year the weather gods were smiling on us. Given that next time I run the WHW I want to do it in less than 3 days, I wanted a new running adventure this year. The <a href=\"http://www.coastalway.co.uk/\">Arran Coastal Way</a> is about 65 miles which seemed a good distance to run over a few days. I was worried it may lack variety but at least we wouldn't have to worry about getting lost - we just had to keep the sea on our right. Even Aisling and I, who had got lost (twice) on an out and back the previous weekend, couldn't go wrong. I gathered some adventure buddies to join the fun and to add some spice we decided to go up the biggest hill on the island on the first day. On Easter Saturday five of us set out early from Brodick and started up Goatfell. I say early, but there were already people coming down the trail as we went up, and it was already quite warm! I regretted wearing a long sleeve top and realised EoÃ­n had probably been right about not needing waterproof trousers. We picked our way up to the summit with some scrambling after leaving the main path by accident. From the top we could see for miles and it was beautiful.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"May 2019","path":"/posts/arran-ultraventure","title":"Arran Ultraventure","tags":null}}},{"node":{"id":"4a59114d-2ed2-5637-9926-54dfef218380","excerpt":"<p>After a spectacular blow up at the Glentress marathon last year I knew I had to return. My training plan was aimed at Glentress as a test to see where I was at and if the plan was working. I had a few goals: to feel strong throughout the second lap, to beat my time from last year, and a half-target of 3:45. The last goal felt a bit ambitious as it was 14 minutes quicker than last year, but it felt like a nice round number to aim for.</p>\n<p>Training had gone well. Iâ€™d finished the hardest week feeling close-but-not-quite-at breaking point and then had a 2 week gradual taper. By the end of race week I was feeling refreshed, strong and focused. I talked Will into running the half marathon the day before and signed up to help out so we could spend the whole weekend down in the Borders. The weather was glorious and marshalling was a lot of fun. The folks at <a href=\"https://www.highterrainevents.co.uk/\">High Terrain Events</a> certainly know how to put on an excellent event. I loved being involved and finished early enough to rest in the afternoon and even have a power nap before dinner.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Mar 2019","path":"/posts/glentress-marathon-round-and-round-again","title":"Glentress marathon: round and round again","tags":null}}},{"node":{"id":"b1dda9cd-d5b1-51fe-9607-99784673a925","excerpt":"<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e6177e328ddd0532334aac9712f1bf06/c54d6/views.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Views\"\n        title=\"Views\"\n        src=\"/static/e6177e328ddd0532334aac9712f1bf06/4b190/views.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e6177e328ddd0532334aac9712f1bf06/e07e9/views.jpg 200w,\n/static/e6177e328ddd0532334aac9712f1bf06/066f9/views.jpg 400w,\n/static/e6177e328ddd0532334aac9712f1bf06/4b190/views.jpg 800w,\n/static/e6177e328ddd0532334aac9712f1bf06/e5166/views.jpg 1200w,\n/static/e6177e328ddd0532334aac9712f1bf06/b17f8/views.jpg 1600w,\n/static/e6177e328ddd0532334aac9712f1bf06/c54d6/views.jpg 4128w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>The hard part of the week was over. All Elaine and I had to do was run from the south to the west coast of the island, via the mountains in the middle and over three days. We planned to run the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?fbclid=IwAR3tnHr3j2z2WaohixaBk8fBdPpUpdneU35-H6GLlZow_vA92SPhBJRkrNw&#x26;mid=1_vQtsQcmuDavUUult_mJtkyD3JWC-xSm&#x26;ll=28.250836142379%2C-16.64608050000004&#x26;z=11\">Bluetrail ultramarathon route</a>. A close look at the route profile the night before we started revealed we would spend the whole of day one, and the start of day two climbing up to over 3500m! To make it a little easier we skipped the initial 10km from sea level and started in Adeje as it was an easy place to leave the car for a few days. We enjoyed a very short run to leave the village, before heading uphill into a forest. The route followed a trail to the village of La Quinta, before winding round to Ilfonche, where we joined the GR131. Luckily Elaine had the gpx file of the route loaded onto her watch, which saved us from getting lost on more than a few occasions.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Jan 2019","path":"/posts/across-tenerife","title":"Across Tenerife","tags":null}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"]}
